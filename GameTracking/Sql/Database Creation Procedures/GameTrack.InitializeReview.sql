	(1, 2,N'The first playthrough of elden ring is one of the best eperiences gaming can offer you but after youve explored everything in the open world and youve experienced all of the surprises you lose motivation to go exploring on repeat playthroughs which takes a lot away from the replayability which is a very important thing for from games imo.',N'2025-08-28'),
(1, 3,N'a replay solidified my love for elden ring. so easily my favorite game of all time. actually beating malenia this time was also an amazing feeling. i just love being in this world man its the greatest of all time',N'2025-03-05'),

If you have a powerful enough pc I definitely recommend you play it on there, if you use keyboard, you’ll want to change the keybinds because the defaults are ass.',N'2024-10-11'),
(1, 10,N'Tied as my favorite souls game with Bloodborne, truly one Ill keep coming back too.',N'2025-05-12'),
(2, 9,N'convinced this is a roguelike for people who do not like the genre. The art is technically good but the aesthetic does very little for me, too clean or something. idk wish I liked it but I do not',N'2024-10-13'),
(2, 4,N'incredible art, a banger soundtrack a surprisingly charming storyline and a big red dog. hades has very smooth gameplay but after playing it for a while it just feels like youre doing the same 3 hit combo ove and over again, which dont get me wrong that combo feels great to do but once i becomes muscle memory you kinda go into autopilot. also i think the boons are cool but i would like to see them change the flow of combat a bit more, there are some cool ones like the grape boon that can change the way you play but most of them are just upgrades that dont really change the gameplay or strategy. other then those 2 small gripes the game is fantastic.',N'2025-03-19'),

(2, 6,N'Não sou muito de jogo indie, admito que joguei poucos, mas devo dizer que Hades foi um dos melhores jogos que joguei na vida, facilmente no top 15. Toda sua arte, dublagem, gameplay, carisma dos personagens, é tudo incrivel',N'2024-09-03'),
(2, 9,N'I cant shake the feeling that I am thoroughly bored playing Hades. Ive picked up Hades three times over the last few years, and three times Ive found myself putting down the controller after a handful of hours, especially after reaching the third stage, and I couldnt figure out why it wasnt working for me. After giving it a few good goes, Ive finally managed to pin down what it is that just doesnt click for me about Hades.',N'2024-07-09'),

(3, 3,N'A really good switch game, however didnt really grip me like mario odyssey',N'2025-02-04'),
(3, 9,N'i was very disappointed by the final boss fight, but the rest of the game is so good it makes me not want to even do the final boss fight anyway just so i can play more of the game. i do wish that there were more unique mechanics in combat besides just parrying and links flurry rush, but the world is really pretty and actually incentivizes exploring it. characters are great, story is great and makes you work for it, and theres tons of hidden secrets and details.',N'2025-03-08'),

Va más allá de un simple juego, es una experiencia que lamentablemente solo se puede vivir una vez en la vida y la recomiendo totalmente.',N'2024-07-06'),
(3, 1,N'em meio a tanto jogo de mundo aberto ruim saindo por aí na última década, acho que da pra entender porque breath of the wild chocou tanto as pessoas no ano em que ele lançou. E realmente eu acho que é o melhor mundo aberto que eu já joguei até hoje, explorar cada pedacinho desse mundo é TÃO GOSTOSO, parece que tudo aqui tá no mapa tem um propósito para estar lá, diferente dos mapas vazios da ubisoft por exemplo. Acho que o unico defeito é esses sistema chatinho de durabilidade das armas, ficar trocando de arma o tempo todo é tão chato, espero que no próximo não tenha.',N'2025-10-29'),

(5, 9,N'I\d give this game a 4 for each individual aspect (platforming, exploration, combat) but the integration and packaging of the content are so good, it\s slightly better that the sum of its parts. Most of the combat and traversal abilities feel useful, and many evoke that Super Metroid-y, gleeful feeling that you\ll finally be able to access that new area, grab that item, or beat that boss. The end-game challenges, reminiscent of Wiley\s fortress and boss rushes after Megaman has fully self-actualized, were the highlight. Boss rushes in particular were fun to dissect and master. I found uses for some charms I had written off as not my style to counter some of the unconventional boss mechanics. My only gripes:\n                     \n                     -The repeated backtracking. I get it - a fast-travel mechanic that\s too liberal can erase the environment, but this was excessive.\n                     \n                     -Some of the charms seemed worthless, even after strategizing for boss, combat, and platforming rushes.\n                     \n                     -In the name of decency and civility, make geo-sucking ability automatic.',N'2025-07-03'),

I feel basil could definitely use some more screentime, the guy rarely gets any in the real world section of the game.

(10, 2,N'NieR: Automata is an unforgettable game. Androids vs. Machines, all while trying to save humanity, and uncover the cold truth of this post-apocalyptic world. 2B and 9S share a common goal, but have differing views through the story. The combat is more fleshed out than its predecessor due to chips and pod mechanics. Characters change and face reality after meeting characters and concepts never seen before.',N'2024-02-25'),
(10, 3,N'This is my favorite game ever and the only game I cared enough about to get the platinum trophy in. I might be biased here but the game has a lot of things I loved going in like the post apocalyptic setting. The game isn’t perfect and while things like the 9s hacking and route b pushed a lot of people away I still thoroughly enjoyed it.

(11, 1,N'This game is great, and to many people this is probably one of the greatest JRPGs if not, overall game of all time. I see that 100%, but I personally have my nitpicks with it, such as:\n                     \n                     -The pacing of the game\n                     \n                     -The fact it only gets good 30-40 hours into the game\n                     \n                     -The fact that essential, strategic, and most importantly, fun mechanics are locked behind confidants such as switching your party mid-battle\n                     \n                     -The lack of freedom to do what you want\n                     \n                     -Similar to SMT IV/IV:A (and maybe other SMT/Persona games, idk) they sell DLC for super powerful personas. In SMTIV at least, these were entirely optional and you had to purchase them. In Persona 5 Royal, they included the DLC, which again, I could ignore if they are optional, but I cant. Unlike in pervious games, there are legitimate fusions using legitimate personas that allow you to straight-up just get these P2W personas naturally, which I absolute fathom and throws the balance of the game out the window.\n                     \n                     -And more importantly, the entirety of Kasumis character pre-third semester (I want to punch her)',N'2024-12-04'),

(11, 9,N'Played like 50 hrs, I guess finished half or two-thirds of it? Cannot say I didnt like Persona 5 at all but this sort of infantile fleur around the characters and situations got me at last. I played some SMT games and they seemed much more sophisticated and thoughtful (especially the 4th). However, I cannot say that Persona 5 is a bad game, although my experience with it was a bit rough. I had this state of waiting for something, like 5-10 hours more, and something incredible would happen for sure, characters pull off some weird moves and the real Persona (the one everyone is so hyped up about) would begin... Never happened. Might finish it sometime later tho, whenever vibes come back.',N'2024-03-17'),

The textures are muddy , the levels especially alabaster Icelands and cobalt coastlands feel janky and overly linear despite the game encouraging more mobile movement and freedom , and of course the lack of meaningful presentation through stiff character animations and lack of voice acting hurt this game alot.

(27, 9,N'hmmmmmmm. Kind of a divisive one here for me personally. While I liked the characters, the plot felt kind of lacking and the connections to the other games in the series that were so hyped up by nintendo in marketing really didnt add to much, if anything. You could have replaced the references to the previous games with original stuff and nothing substantial would be different. In that aspect, this game was really disappointing. The villains were also an absolute joke, with the Mobius guys being the most generically boring guys in history and N being immensely less cool the more you learn about him. In terms of the gameplay though, it was certainly fun. The class system makes combat very customizable and I feel its absolutely possible to sink your teeth really into managing your party to get the most out of all your options. I also did a lot of side content in this game, which is uncharacteristic of me as I beelined it through the first two games. Exploration of the worlds is always fun in xenoblade games, and this is no exception. Perhaps I am just getting tired of the series, but this definitely didnt hit as much as the first or even the second game to me. Still would suggest to anyone that enjoyed the first two games because the gameplay is still fun but like yeaaaahh...',N'2024-03-05'),

A year or two later, I would play through the whole game, and later the DLC, in co-op with a friend. We did this over Steam so there was a bit of lag, but I had a controller and a friend to help me through. I enjoyed the game a lot more, to the point where I was the one pushing us to do the DLC together, but it still didnt quite enamour me like Id wanted it to. My main complaint at the time was the design of some of the bosses. I felt that a lot of them relied on being able to pay attention to cues and bullets coming from multiple parts of the screen, often with them all acting completely independently. I have a huge amount of trouble processing all of that information, so oftentimes I found bosses just far too overwhelming. Not a design issue or anything, more of a personal one.',N'2025-02-15'),

(36, 1,N'Loved this a lot. I missed the sense of exploration from Dark Souls, but the core action mechanics and satisfying parries more than made up for it. Other than a basic whole number for your damage and health, there\s no worrying about RPG values here. It\s a true action game taking place within the open-world Metroid-ish Souls structure, backed up with\n                     \n                      some\n                     \n                     items and buffs and junk if you decide to use them. But the lack of gear is probably the best thing about this - no armour sets, no elemental stats, no sword that deals +5 damage but -2 stamina. Funnily enough, people say this is the hardest FromSoftware game, but after a while it felt much, much easier to me than Dark Souls\n                     \n                      because\n                     \n                     there was nothing in my way except my own skill, which I greatly prefer. No main bosses that required some stupid consumable item for me to defeat properly. I don\t like feeling as if I need to grind to make myself better, because then it\s this vague guessing game of numbers. There were a few points in Dark Souls where I felt robbed of a boss fight because I must have been over-levelled, or I said screw it, summoned an NPC once and then steam-rolled the boss. No hollow victories here in Sekiro - although admittedly, once you get that perfect parry timing down, sometimes victory comes so fast that it\n                     \n                      almost\n                     \n                     feels unsatisfying.

Still has a lot of baffling decisions sprinkled throughout, though, which isn\t new for a Fromsoft game but this game is far more rigid in terms of there being a correct way to approach encounters so it only magnifies these issues when they appear. Soulsborne games (and ESPECIALLY Elden Ring) usually have a billion different ways you can break the game over your knee if something is really giving you trouble, but most of the time in Sekiro if the game throws something at you that\s bad and sucks you have to actually engage with the thing that\s bad and sucks, and that\s bad and sucks.',N'2025-01-15'),

(45, 5,N'I remember not thinking too much about the original RE2. Dont get me wrong, its a great game, but with REmake, RE3 and Code Veronica it was for me the weakest in the classic style saga. Then came this game in 2019. Holy fuck. Not only was this the first RE game I played on launch, but it just blew me away with how polished it was. The police station feels more real than ever, with dark and immersive areas that make you feel trapped and scared. The graphics also contribute to this, being incredibly realistic yet stylized, even if spme faces look a bit weird. I complained about how in the original RE playing as both characters wasnt worth it because the story barely changed, but thats completely fixed here. Not only do each of them have compelling and really different stories, but they also have different accessible rooms, gameplay segments and even final bosses. Another recurring problem with this franchise is that the best area is always the first one, and although thats also the case here, both the sewers and the lab are really fun and memorable in their own way.

Cloud is an absolute black hole of charisma. Nobody is fun to play as except for Barrett, who has the most simple combat systems out of the 4 options.',N'2025-10-16'),

I did find it to be very difficult at points and it can be somewhat easy to get lost. Also a vital system for progression can be too cryptic, but rewarding once you crack it.

(63, 8,N'Tunic is a wonderful 2D Zelda-like that feels like a love letter to the genre. Between an extremely charming aesthetic, fun and interesting items, and being extremely packed with puzzles and mystery, it would be hard not to recommend this game to any fan of the genre. The inclusions of things like a made up language and the instruction booklet all work to great effect to simulate that feeling you had when you were a kid trying to play a game like Links Awakening. Discovery is always well rewarded and always feel earned by the player. I feel as though there are very few handouts in terms of progression through the game, so even just simply navigating the world feels meaningful and accomplishing. Level design is top notch in this game and I love all the secrets and hidden paths they provide using the games isometric view.

Amazing levels, dialogue, music, and graphics with a lot of interesting choices that change little things, but still is fun to enjoy. Calling your buddies to do certain abilities in combat is so fun and makes you feel like the leader of a team, and the enemies are cool as well with a lot of alien variety. I think the biggest issue is that it drags on a bit longer than expected with some filler, and you dont get all your powers until the second to last planet. Another small issue I had is your character itself isnt too interesting. The shooting from your guns feels pretty weak, and there isnt a lot of variety in your own movements or cool abilities like the ones your friends have.

The soundtrack is really good and I enjoyed the characters quite a bit, even if they could feel quite dimensional. You dont really get that many RPG elements so you cant really focus or build on specific aspects, but it reminds me of a more streamlined monster hunter when combating robots using only slings and arrows. I think the game definitely was missing a lot of aspects that are commonplace in the genre, but this was their first open-world game. There were frustrating moments, and a lot of the times enemies move too quickly even during slow-mo to let you take advantage of shooting weak points, and I think the melee combat is pretty terrible. A light and a heavy sweep, that is pretty much it. The platforming is really good but also got annoying to traverse sometimes, epseically with how many mountain areas there are.

Jyun pulls a knife on Kiryu and another man appears out of nowhere and also interferes. A police officer also shows up. The man with the big head is frustrated that he made a mistake, but this causes the couple to run off. The man then reveals to Kiryu that he is called Shinohara.

The era of Ninja Turtles that most intrest me like im sure many, is the 80s cartoon era. This game is a really cool time capsule of not only by playing into the iconic gameplay style of the time ( the Konami Ninja Turtle arcade games), but it perseveres most of the original voice actors, art style, referances and characters. The game almost can feel like a crash course to somebody like me who doesnt know much about the series, which I really apreciate. There are some really good tracks in this, most of which were composed by the Sonic Mania composer. The physical edition even came with a Pizza Hut coupon for a free personal pan pizza, which is incredible (I ate pizza pretty much every time I played this game).

Generally speaking, I enjoy playing stealth games with a controller. Stealth, like racing games, is a genre that benefits greatly from analog sticks. At the heart of a great stealth game is nail-biting tension and suspense. Vulnerability is stressed through risk outweighing reward. On a keyboard, all of your inputs are static. Are you pressing up? Good, you\re moving up. Jolting an analog stick up can mean the difference between shuffling silently and bringing in nearby ears for inspection. Even in games where this choice tends to be an illusion, it heightens the already high stakes of weaving in and out of crowded spaces as little more than a specter in the night.

Half the time youll be running around an empty level looking for that one door that gives you a yellow keycard with nothing in it, and the music is more like butchered versions of famous metal songs. The guns are great and the enemy design is rich and unique, but I really felt like they werent used to their full capability.

(134, 0,N'This is a collection of a bunch of vignettes that all play with JRPG tropes in unique ways, and for the most part I found these stories really unique and entertaining. This feels like the predecessor to Chrono Trigger in many ways, so fans of that game will immediately see similarities. It’s mostly a very accessible game, but my one big fault is that the game lets you choose any of these chapters to start with. Certain chapters I enjoyed within the context of the rest of the game, but are particularly unconventional and could make for a very weak first impression. Aside from that tho, I honestly loved this. Combat is a big standout for me, each encounter was like a mini tactics battle with a really fun grid system. I had to thoughtfully consider how to dispatch enemies effectively, and while it’s far from a difficult game, each battle had me engaged. Presentation is gorgeous with the HD-2D Switch remake, it’s a total overhaul that still remains faithful to the original. While some chapters are definitely weaker than others, I thoroughly enjoyed the majority of my time with this game. And while I won’t spoil the final segments that come after you finish the seven main chapters, I found them to be so fun and satisfying that they elevate the entire experience. This definitely deserves to be considered a classic of the era right alongside FFVI and Chrono Trigger.',N'2025-07-29'),

(134, 1,N'Honestly, there just wasnt enough here to keep me engaged. Most of the chapters dont encourage exploration, the combat is lackluster with little to no skill involved, and the characters are underwhelming on the whole with very little emotional impact. The space episode was the best one that I got to, and even that had me rolling my eyes at some points. I expect more from RPGs, even remasters of old classics.

As most reviews for this game have said, its really great that failing a skill check does not necessarily mean youre now going through a worse version of the game (in some cases its even a more fun route). The politics and wordbuilding are also super deep and will really please those who enjoy those topics in their media.  I personally found myself more engrossed by the games study of the main character, who was as awful and destructive as he was likeable and relatable. I also found it incredible how the writers have managed to give him his own personality while also allowing a huge amount of his character to be determined by the player. Normally games tend to present one of these two archetypes for their main character, but this mixture of both helps a lot in giving the player a much deeper connection with the character while also allowing the character to serve the main themes of the story.\n                     \n                     On that note, the amount of choices they give you for customizing him are insane, and they really dont feel overwhelming despite there being multiple methods to change your character.

O jogo resolve usar uma abordagem mais simples, com apenas uma arma e alguns tipos de munições que em suma maioria é utilizada de maneira pontual ao decorrer da jogatina. A gameplay simples e relativamente repetitiva não é um problema aqui, visto que o jogo possui um enredo rico em detalhes e que consegue desenvolver sua premissa com perfeição.

And the visual style? Oh my god. I adore how this game looks so much, I want every game to look like this. It is so, so full of charm and colour and personality. Give me a Mario game that looks like this, give me a Pokemon game that looks like this, give me a fuckin GTA game that looks like this!! Genuinely what I would love more than anything else in the world is for the Zelda series - after Tears Of The Kingdom to come back to this style for the next mainline game. Dont just keep this relegated to remakes if you do Oracle Of Seasons & Ages, give me a full-on, original, top-down open-world game with this visual style. Drop me in a place as beautiful and mysterious as Koholint, tell me very little and let me discover it all on my own.',N'2024-04-21'),
(190, 4,N'In this first game, the story and switching between present day (circa 2007) and the past set in the Crusade era Holy Land is such an intriguing premise and the authenticity of the world and character design can be admired. That isn’t to say the game is the worst thing ever, but it truly is soooooooo tedious and repetitive that it’s tough to recommend. The parkour system is very cool and has a lot of attention to detail put into the running and climbing animations. Scaling towers and doing Leaps of Faiths is so fun which somewhat makes up for the overabundance of sync points. There are many other menial side missions that, while not lacking in variety, are just copy and pasted everywhere and it gets tiring very quickly. Play it if you’re curious as some of the stealth is fun (and a little more low key compared to later entires in the series), but don’t be surprised if it gets dull very quickly.',N'2025-02-24'),
(190, 7,N'Sinceramente, eu não curti. Sei que é o primeiro jogo e que as mecânicas ainda eram um rascunho, mas, caramba, é torturante escalar, o combate não tem diversidade nenhuma e o protagonista, apesar de interessante, não tem quase nada de carisma, sempre falando em tom neutro e sem expressar emoção.\n                     \n                     Para um início, mesmo levando em conta as limitações, ainda é bem fraco. É só ver que Prince of Persia fez mecânicas muito mais agradáveis, e que este deveria ser uma evolução pelo menos das escaladas, mas não é o que acontece. Basicamente o jogo não tem stealth, e isso matou a graça de muitas missões, pois você basicamente chega no inimigo e esfaqueia, depois aperta o botão para disfarçar. Me vi muitas vezes frustrado por ter de fazer missões repetitivas de assassinato onde tinham 3 alvos e se eu falhasse, ficava mais difícil porque os corpos dos que eu matei ainda estavam lá e os guardas ficavam em alerta, dificultando conseguir assassinar o alvo sem falhar, e as vezes os npcs (os loucos), simplesmente me empurravam, eu esbarrava em um guardsne falhava a missão.

I then played it again more recently, a couple of years ago to re-experience it and I love it. Ezio is the golden child of the series but Altair truly embodies the assassin in my mind infinitely better. Cold, calculating while still maintaining his humanity and code. I loved the city, running around and exploring while fighting enemies, but you definitely felt like there couldve been more tools to use in the game. I also really liked the Desmond sections, they had juuuussst enough mystery to them without being overwhelming.

(198, 6,N'Missle the dog is in this game, thats all you need to know to get you to play it',N'2025-06-29'),
(198, 3,N'Ghost Trick é FACILMENTE um dos melhores jogos de DS, não bastando a sua gameplay única e diversificada com o touch, cada puzzle é único, sua narrativa contextualiza de forma genial suas Ghost Tricks, seu cast principal é perfeito e não só tem uma construção boa pro seu propósito como transmitem vida com ajuda das animações fabulosas e até mesmo extravagantes que tornam satisfatório cada momento que você não está no controle, ouso dizer ainda que a IGN está errada, a linearidade da obra a torna crível e funcional no meio de tudo que a engloba e não é um defeito\n                     \n                     A trilha Sonora arrebenta, composições extremamente boas para seus momentos e efeitos sonoros de alta qualidade\n                     \n                     O texto é muito bom, sabendo que nenhuma explicação seria boa o suficiente foca na sua temática de morte, arrependimento, destino, causa e consequência ao invés de se demorar com a origem do seu poder. Ainda sim, sua explicação é aceitável e se torna um bom recurso de roteiro, e até que se prove o contrário é passível de não ter furos de roteiro ou pontas soltas sendo gratificante cada mistério resolvido e inserido, a construção para o grand finale não poderia ser melhor',N'2024-04-18'),
(198, 4,N'pretty wild that this was made by the same people as ace attorney considering that ace attorney sucks, and this rocks.',N'2024-07-23'),
(199, 5,N'It is the most alrightest modern Dragon Quest. Im glad I finally saw it through in my quest to beat all the Dragon Quests. Its the top of the middle of the pack, and a great place to start.',N'2025-08-03'),
(199, 2,N'Epic adventure',N'2024-04-09'),
(199, 9,N'lo pude jugar cuando me rostice la pierna y no podia ir a trabajar por una semana, me hizo olvidar que cuando daba un paso mi pierna se desintegraba, nada que ver la reseña pero bueno que tal todo bien yo maso pero al menos ya se me curo la pierna',N'2023-12-07'),
(199, 2,N'I feel like I have to get myself into the certain mindset where I can enjoy dragon quest after playing more intense jrpgs for a while. I had fun with this but the plot of this game especially the postgame time travel stuff felt incredibly mishandled and actually undid what small part of this story where the protagonist loses and Veronica sacrifices herself. Even though I wasn’t much of a fan of this game it did encourage me to play the others',N'2023-11-27'),
(199, 1,N'Cozy JRPG. Havent played any other DQ games but this was a really nice experience. Although the formula is simple, its made interesting by the amount of skills and upgrades. The characters wouldve never met but now weve got a full party, sure hope we dont have to fight a god!',N'2024-12-24'),
(199, 3,N'So, what the hell is Act 3?',N'2025-03-24'),
(200, 3,N'i havent technically completed it yet. the final boss is super fucking hard.',N'2023-12-06'),
(200, 9,N'Test',N'2025-04-13'),
(200, 8,N'I wanted to see what the hype was about. I never got very far in the game before things happened to make me stop playing. I do kind of want to give it another try, but who knows if thatll happen.',N'2024-01-06'),
(200, 8,N'The writing, the characters, the combat system, the minigames, and the levels are all top notch, especially the wrestling level.',N'2025-09-24'),
(200, 5,N'I know most folks are kinda sick of hearing people praise this game nowadays, but still, thats for a reason, its still a masterpiece!',N'2025-04-01'),
(200, 2,N'very good game,but i was dumb as fuck and thought this was the first paper mario game',N'2025-07-26');

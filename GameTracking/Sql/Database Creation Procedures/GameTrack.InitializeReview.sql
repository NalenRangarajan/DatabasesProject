	(1, 2,N'The first playthrough of elden ring is one of the best eperiences gaming can offer you but after youve explored everything in the open world and youve experienced all of the surprises you lose motivation to go exploring on repeat playthroughs which takes a lot away from the replayability which is a very important thing for from games imo.',N'2025-08-28'),
(1, 3,N'a replay solidified my love for elden ring. so easily my favorite game of all time. actually beating malenia this time was also an amazing feeling. i just love being in this world man its the greatest of all time',N'2025-03-05'),

(1, 5,N'I play with my overlevelled friend every time and we still fail sometimes (he’s on NG6), insanely difficult game lol\n                     \n                     gorgeous graphics, animations, everything about this game is so beautiful. deserves all the hype it gets. If you have a powerful enough pc I definitely recommend you play it on there, if you use keyboard, you’ll want to change the keybinds because the defaults are ass.',N'2024-10-11'),
(1, 10,N'Tied as my favorite souls game with Bloodborne, truly one Ill keep coming back too.',N'2025-05-12'),
(2, 9,N'convinced this is a roguelike for people who do not like the genre. The art is technically good but the aesthetic does very little for me, too clean or something. idk wish I liked it but I do not',N'2024-10-13'),
(2, 4,N'incredible art, a banger soundtrack a surprisingly charming storyline and a big red dog. hades has very smooth gameplay but after playing it for a while it just feels like youre doing the same 3 hit combo ove and over again, which dont get me wrong that combo feels great to do but once i becomes muscle memory you kinda go into autopilot. also i think the boons are cool but i would like to see them change the flow of combat a bit more, there are some cool ones like the grape boon that can change the way you play but most of them are just upgrades that dont really change the gameplay or strategy. other then those 2 small gripes the game is fantastic.',N'2025-03-19'),

(2, 6,N'Não sou muito de jogo indie, admito que joguei poucos, mas devo dizer que Hades foi um dos melhores jogos que joguei na vida, facilmente no top 15. Toda sua arte, dublagem, gameplay, carisma dos personagens, é tudo incrivel',N'2024-09-03'),
(2, 9,N'I cant shake the feeling that I am thoroughly bored playing Hades. Ive picked up Hades three times over the last few years, and three times Ive found myself putting down the controller after a handful of hours, especially after reaching the third stage, and I couldnt figure out why it wasnt working for me. After giving it a few good goes, Ive finally managed to pin down what it is that just doesnt click for me about Hades.',N'2024-07-09'),
(2, 9,N'One of my favorites in the rogue-likes/lites, only being beat by binding of Isaac. I love the characters (Thanatos my beloved) and the writing and the art style and RRRAAAAHHH THIS GAME IS AWESOME',N'2025-07-06'),

(3, 3,N'A really good switch game, however didnt really grip me like mario odyssey',N'2025-02-04'),
(3, 9,N'i was very disappointed by the final boss fight, but the rest of the game is so good it makes me not want to even do the final boss fight anyway just so i can play more of the game. i do wish that there were more unique mechanics in combat besides just parrying and links flurry rush, but the world is really pretty and actually incentivizes exploring it. characters are great, story is great and makes you work for it, and theres tons of hidden secrets and details.',N'2025-03-08'),

Va más allá de un simple juego, es una experiencia que lamentablemente solo se puede vivir una vez en la vida y la recomiendo totalmente.',N'2024-07-06'),
(3, 1,N'em meio a tanto jogo de mundo aberto ruim saindo por aí na última década, acho que da pra entender porque breath of the wild chocou tanto as pessoas no ano em que ele lançou. E realmente eu acho que é o melhor mundo aberto que eu já joguei até hoje, explorar cada pedacinho desse mundo é TÃO GOSTOSO, parece que tudo aqui tá no mapa tem um propósito para estar lá, diferente dos mapas vazios da ubisoft por exemplo. Acho que o unico defeito é esses sistema chatinho de durabilidade das armas, ficar trocando de arma o tempo todo é tão chato, espero que no próximo não tenha.',N'2025-10-29'),

(5, 1,N'this games worldbuilding is incredible, with its amazing soundtrack and gorgeous art direction it really makes you feel like youre spiderman.  one of the best value in gaming tbh, this game is packed full of content and none of it feels like filler. even the boss rush manages to feel fresh by introducing some surprise bosses/boss variants as rewards for beating tough pantheons. cant wait to play silksong when i turn 80!',N'2023-12-30'),

(5, 7,N'A rivetting action/adventure game with a stunning design. Extremely rewarding but also gruesomly difficult at times.',N'2024-08-03'),
(5, 9,N'I\d give this game a 4 for each individual aspect (platforming, exploration, combat) but the integration and packaging of the content are so good, it\s slightly better that the sum of its parts. Most of the combat and traversal abilities feel useful, and many evoke that Super Metroid-y, gleeful feeling that you\ll finally be able to access that new area, grab that item, or beat that boss. The end-game challenges, reminiscent of Wiley\s fortress and boss rushes after Megaman has fully self-actualized, were the highlight. Boss rushes in particular were fun to dissect and master. I found uses for some charms I had written off as not my style to counter some of the unconventional boss mechanics. My only gripes:\n                     \n                     -The repeated backtracking. I get it - a fast-travel mechanic that\s too liberal can erase the environment, but this was excessive.\n                     \n                     -Some of the charms seemed worthless, even after strategizing for boss, combat, and platforming rushes.\n                     \n                     -In the name of decency and civility, make geo-sucking ability automatic.',N'2025-07-03'),

I feel basil could definitely use some more screentime, the guy rarely gets any in the real world section of the game. The writing is pretty good too though I\m not a fan of the le quirky random indie game writing xdddd like this game has but there were times where it did make me chuckle.',N'2024-05-02'),

(10, 2,N'NieR: Automata is an unforgettable game. Androids vs. Machines, all while trying to save humanity, and uncover the cold truth of this post-apocalyptic world. 2B and 9S share a common goal, but have differing views through the story. The combat is more fleshed out than its predecessor due to chips and pod mechanics. Characters change and face reality after meeting characters and concepts never seen before.',N'2024-02-25'),
(10, 3,N'This is my favorite game ever and the only game I cared enough about to get the platinum trophy in. I might be biased here but the game has a lot of things I loved going in like the post apocalyptic setting. The game isn’t perfect and while things like the 9s hacking and route b pushed a lot of people away I still thoroughly enjoyed it.

(11, 1,N'This game is great, and to many people this is probably one of the greatest JRPGs if not, overall game of all time. I see that 100%, but I personally have my nitpicks with it, such as:\n                     \n                     -The pacing of the game\n                     \n                     -The fact it only gets good 30-40 hours into the game\n                     \n                     -The fact that essential, strategic, and most importantly, fun mechanics are locked behind confidants such as switching your party mid-battle\n                     \n                     -The lack of freedom to do what you want\n                     \n                     -Similar to SMT IV/IV:A (and maybe other SMT/Persona games, idk) they sell DLC for super powerful personas. In SMTIV at least, these were entirely optional and you had to purchase them. In Persona 5 Royal, they included the DLC, which again, I could ignore if they are optional, but I cant. Unlike in pervious games, there are legitimate fusions using legitimate personas that allow you to straight-up just get these P2W personas naturally, which I absolute fathom and throws the balance of the game out the window.\n                     \n                     -And more importantly, the entirety of Kasumis character pre-third semester (I want to punch her)',N'2024-12-04'),

(11, 9,N'Played like 50 hrs, I guess finished half or two-thirds of it? Cannot say I didnt like Persona 5 at all but this sort of infantile fleur around the characters and situations got me at last. I played some SMT games and they seemed much more sophisticated and thoughtful (especially the 4th). However, I cannot say that Persona 5 is a bad game, although my experience with it was a bit rough. I had this state of waiting for something, like 5-10 hours more, and something incredible would happen for sure, characters pull off some weird moves and the real Persona (the one everyone is so hyped up about) would begin... Never happened. Might finish it sometime later tho, whenever vibes come back.',N'2024-03-17'),

The textures are muddy , the levels especially alabaster Icelands and cobalt coastlands feel janky and overly linear despite the game encouraging more mobile movement and freedom , and of course the lack of meaningful presentation through stiff character animations and lack of voice acting hurt this game alot.

(27, 9,N'hmmmmmmm. Kind of a divisive one here for me personally. While I liked the characters, the plot felt kind of lacking and the connections to the other games in the series that were so hyped up by nintendo in marketing really didnt add to much, if anything. You could have replaced the references to the previous games with original stuff and nothing substantial would be different. In that aspect, this game was really disappointing. The villains were also an absolute joke, with the Mobius guys being the most generically boring guys in history and N being immensely less cool the more you learn about him. In terms of the gameplay though, it was certainly fun. The class system makes combat very customizable and I feel its absolutely possible to sink your teeth really into managing your party to get the most out of all your options. I also did a lot of side content in this game, which is uncharacteristic of me as I beelined it through the first two games. Exploration of the worlds is always fun in xenoblade games, and this is no exception. Perhaps I am just getting tired of the series, but this definitely didnt hit as much as the first or even the second game to me. Still would suggest to anyone that enjoyed the first two games because the gameplay is still fun but like yeaaaahh...',N'2024-03-05'),

A year or two later, I would play through the whole game, and later the DLC, in co-op with a friend. We did this over Steam so there was a bit of lag, but I had a controller and a friend to help me through. I enjoyed the game a lot more, to the point where I was the one pushing us to do the DLC together, but it still didnt quite enamour me like Id wanted it to. My main complaint at the time was the design of some of the bosses. I felt that a lot of them relied on being able to pay attention to cues and bullets coming from multiple parts of the screen, often with them all acting completely independently. I have a huge amount of trouble processing all of that information, so oftentimes I found bosses just far too overwhelming. Not a design issue or anything, more of a personal one.',N'2025-02-15'),

(36, 1,N'Loved this a lot. I missed the sense of exploration from Dark Souls, but the core action mechanics and satisfying parries more than made up for it. Other than a basic whole number for your damage and health, there\s no worrying about RPG values here. It\s a true action game taking place within the open-world Metroid-ish Souls structure, backed up with\n                     \n                      some\n                     \n                     items and buffs and junk if you decide to use them. But the lack of gear is probably the best thing about this - no armour sets, no elemental stats, no sword that deals +5 damage but -2 stamina. Funnily enough, people say this is the hardest FromSoftware game, but after a while it felt much, much easier to me than Dark Souls\n                     \n                      because\n                     \n                     there was nothing in my way except my own skill, which I greatly prefer. No main bosses that required some stupid consumable item for me to defeat properly. I don\t like feeling as if I need to grind to make myself better, because then it\s this vague guessing game of numbers. There were a few points in Dark Souls where I felt robbed of a boss fight because I must have been over-levelled, or I said screw it, summoned an NPC once and then steam-rolled the boss. No hollow victories here in Sekiro - although admittedly, once you get that perfect parry timing down, sometimes victory comes so fast that it\n                     \n                      almost\n                     \n                     feels unsatisfying.

Still has a lot of baffling decisions sprinkled throughout, though, which isn\t new for a Fromsoft game but this game is far more rigid in terms of there being a correct way to approach encounters so it only magnifies these issues when they appear. Soulsborne games (and ESPECIALLY Elden Ring) usually have a billion different ways you can break the game over your knee if something is really giving you trouble, but most of the time in Sekiro if the game throws something at you that\s bad and sucks you have to actually engage with the thing that\s bad and sucks, and that\s bad and sucks.',N'2025-01-15'),

(45, 5,N'I remember not thinking too much about the original RE2. Dont get me wrong, its a great game, but with REmake, RE3 and Code Veronica it was for me the weakest in the classic style saga. Then came this game in 2019. Holy fuck. Not only was this the first RE game I played on launch, but it just blew me away with how polished it was. The police station feels more real than ever, with dark and immersive areas that make you feel trapped and scared. The graphics also contribute to this, being incredibly realistic yet stylized, even if spme faces look a bit weird. I complained about how in the original RE playing as both characters wasnt worth it because the story barely changed, but thats completely fixed here. Not only do each of them have compelling and really different stories, but they also have different accessible rooms, gameplay segments and even final bosses. Another recurring problem with this franchise is that the best area is always the first one, and although thats also the case here, both the sewers and the lab are really fun and memorable in their own way.

Cloud is an absolute black hole of charisma. Nobody is fun to play as except for Barrett, who has the most simple combat systems out of the 4 options.',N'2025-10-16'),

I did find it to be very difficult at points and it can be somewhat easy to get lost. Also a vital system for progression can be too cryptic, but rewarding once you crack it.

(63, 8,N'Tunic is a wonderful 2D Zelda-like that feels like a love letter to the genre. Between an extremely charming aesthetic, fun and interesting items, and being extremely packed with puzzles and mystery, it would be hard not to recommend this game to any fan of the genre. The inclusions of things like a made up language and the instruction booklet all work to great effect to simulate that feeling you had when you were a kid trying to play a game like Links Awakening. Discovery is always well rewarded and always feel earned by the player. I feel as though there are very few handouts in terms of progression through the game, so even just simply navigating the world feels meaningful and accomplishing. Level design is top notch in this game and I love all the secrets and hidden paths they provide using the games isometric view.

(81, 0,N'Sei que vou ser só mais um chatão que não amou por isso e aquilo, mas eu tenho meus problemas com este jogo.

Por um lado é bom para recompensar a exploração mais minuciosa, mas por outro é muito anti-intuitivo.\n                     \n                     A atmosfera do jogo e a ambientação são ótimas, mas eu sinto que focou demais no terror, na opressão, às vezes até no grotesco e bizarro, e isso meio que me tira um pouco a diversão, tratando-se de um resident evil, onde uma das coisas que mais gosto é o gerenciamento de itens definir mais o combate que se você está nervoso com um inimigo que você não consegue enfrentar direito por ele ser muito resistente e ser um saco acertar na cabeça.\n                     \n                     No mais, acho um bom jogo, com bons personagens e com um rumo que não foi ruim pra franquia.

(82, 2,N'Its hard to review this game. It has the best gameplay in the series, easily, but thats constantly interrupted by helicopter rides, visits to Mother Base, selecting your loadouts (even though, for me, it was the same loadout for almost every mission) and micromanaging your many recruits. Still, while youre actually in the field, the stealth gameplay feels excellent. But then it has the absolute worst story in the series. On the plus side... kinda... the vast majority of the story is on cassette tapes that are completely optional.',N'2024-11-29'),
(82, 9,N'Only 10-15 hours into this game and already it\s one of my favorites of all time. Let me illustrate why via some comparisons.\n                     \n                     Average Call of Duty mission: Walk in a straight line. Kill some people.\n                     \n                     Average F.E.A.R. mission: Walk in a straight line until you reach an arena where you will move around strategically and kill some people.\n                     \n                     Average Far Cry 3/4 mission: Drive across the world until you reach the location. Hide on a hill and snipe every bad guy at the base, then walk inside. Or sneak inside, I don\t care. This funnels you into a segment where you walk forward and kill people.\n                     \n                     Average MSGV mission: You have 15 minutes to destroy enemy vehicles. Their path is marked on your Pip Boy. Call in a supply drop for a grenade launcher up ahead, then ride on your horse to get ahead of a tank, pick up the grenade launcher, and ambush the tank. Next, ride across a bridge to the other side of a river, plant some C4, set up an ammo drop, go prone, and wait for another vehicle to pass by so you can blow it up. Next, you get a message that a Jeep is transporting a prisoner you need to extract. It\s across the river. User your sniper rifle to kill the driver and guard, run across the river, extract the prisoner, park the Jeep in the middle of the road so that it stops the next vehicle that is coming your way. Find a place to hide so you can ambush the vehicle. This is just the first half of the mission. And if you die, you can approach it a completely different way.\n                     \n                     This game feels like it takes Far Cry 4 and turns every gameplay element except for the open world up to 11. Instead of just shutting down the radios at a base, you can destroy their comms equipment, their anti-air radar, and their electrical power. Don\t just shut off the lights--shut off the lights, plant C4 on the power source, and then blow up the guy who comes by to turn the lights on.  But be careful, because the enemies will react to anything you do. Keep turning the lights off and they will start wearing night-vision goggles.\n                     \n                     The amount of things you can do in this game is amazing. Even though the game is relatively difficult (for me, anyway), it always feels fair. It\s always clear what killed me, and successfully completing a mission is less a matter of just getting better at doing a specific thing and more a matter of changing tactics. Enemy behavior is some of the most realistic and immersive I\ve seen in a stealth game. Sure, you can cheese the AI, but you really have to work for it, instead of just going round the corner so the enemies forget your presence. It really does feel like living through an awesome action movie rather than playing a video game.\n                     \n                     I only have a few complaints. One is that the open world really is empty; there\s nothing besides enemy bases. I wouldn\t so much call this an open world game as an open arena game or a semi-sandbox game or something equally clunky.  The goal of the open world in this game is not so much to simulate a living, breathing world (like Skyrim or Far Cry 4), but to give you a large area of operations for your missions. It succeeds in that regard, but I do wish there had been some more dynamic events happening. My other complaint is with the base management portion of the game--it feels like a mobile game, and takes away from the action. I want to be sneaking around and shooting stuff, not clicking through a menu.\n                     \n                     These are small complaints, however, and I can safely say that this game is one of the best games I have ever played. Since the game regularly goes on sale for a steep discount, I heartily recommend buying it.\n                     \n                     One more thing: you can put your own music into the game to play through your Pokedex or on the helicopter. There\s nothing quite as iconic as blasting through a base while Back in Black blares through the stereo, or having your chopper play Born in the USA every time it picks you up.',N'2024-08-20'),

Platforming is responsive and the environments at least offer interesting ways to use platforming ability from time to time. I think this balances out to an overall fine experience.

Another small issue I had is your character itself isnt too interesting.

The soundtrack is really good and I enjoyed the characters quite a bit, even if they could feel quite dimensional. You dont really get that many RPG elements so you cant really focus or build on specific aspects, but it reminds me of a more streamlined monster hunter when combating robots using only slings and arrows. I think the game definitely was missing a lot of aspects that are commonplace in the genre, but this was their first open-world game. There were frustrating moments, and a lot of the times enemies move too quickly even during slow-mo to let you take advantage of shooting weak points, and I think the melee combat is pretty terrible. A light and a heavy sweep, that is pretty much it. The platforming is really good but also got annoying to traverse sometimes, epseically with how many mountain areas there are.

Generally speaking, I enjoy playing stealth games with a controller. Stealth, like racing games, is a genre that benefits greatly from analog sticks. At the heart of a great stealth game is nail-biting tension and suspense. Vulnerability is stressed through risk outweighing reward. On a keyboard, all of your inputs are static. Are you pressing up? Good, you\re moving up. Jolting an analog stick up can mean the difference between shuffling silently and bringing in nearby ears for inspection. Even in games where this choice tends to be an illusion, it heightens the already high stakes of weaving in and out of crowded spaces as little more than a specter in the night. If that\s how you choose to play\n                     \n                      Dishonored\n                     \n                     , I recommend it.

(134, 0,N'This is a collection of a bunch of vignettes that all play with JRPG tropes in unique ways, and for the most part I found these stories really unique and entertaining. This feels like the predecessor to Chrono Trigger in many ways, so fans of that game will immediately see similarities. It’s mostly a very accessible game, but my one big fault is that the game lets you choose any of these chapters to start with. Certain chapters I enjoyed within the context of the rest of the game, but are particularly unconventional and could make for a very weak first impression. Aside from that tho, I honestly loved this. Combat is a big standout for me, each encounter was like a mini tactics battle with a really fun grid system. I had to thoughtfully consider how to dispatch enemies effectively, and while it’s far from a difficult game, each battle had me engaged. Presentation is gorgeous with the HD-2D Switch remake, it’s a total overhaul that still remains faithful to the original. While some chapters are definitely weaker than others, I thoroughly enjoyed the majority of my time with this game. And while I won’t spoil the final segments that come after you finish the seven main chapters, I found them to be so fun and satisfying that they elevate the entire experience.

The politics and wordbuilding are also super deep and will really please those who enjoy those topics in their media.  I personally found myself more engrossed by the games study of the main character, who was as awful and destructive as he was likeable and relatable. I also found it incredible how the writers have managed to give him his own personality while also allowing a huge amount of his character to be determined by the player. Normally games tend to present one of these two archetypes for their main character, but this mixture of both helps a lot in giving the player a much deeper connection with the character while also allowing the character to serve the main themes of the story.\n                     \n                     On that note, the amount of choices they give you for customizing him are insane, and they really dont feel overwhelming despite there being multiple methods to change your character.

(178, 8,N'I really enjoyed this game. My relationship with the Metroid series is one of admiration. It’s not my favorite series but there’s lots that I love about it. Fusion is a very fun time. A lot of your Metroid staples are more streamlined and made more linear. You would think this would be a bad thing but it was actually very refreshing. Exploration is a key staple of the series and there is some of that here but sometimes in past games it feels too cryptic and unintuitive. It’s easy to get stuck and I don’t have time to waste now that I’m older lol. The enemy design is great, the graphics are crisp, sound design is great, soundtrack was nothing too amazing. This game has some of the coolest designed bosses and some great fights. It’s fun it’s not super long and the story is interesting. I really enjoyed it and I think you will too.

The most limited title of them all (save maybe Metroid 2, which this calls back to a lot, funnily enough), with what is normally a joyous full-powered clean-up turned into a pain in the arse slog.\n                     \n                     But... just dont play it like that.

Give me a Mario game that looks like this, give me a Pokemon game that looks like this, give me a fuckin GTA game that looks like this!! Genuinely what I would love more than anything else in the world is for the Zelda series - after Tears Of The Kingdom to come back to this style for the next mainline game. Dont just keep this relegated to remakes if you do Oracle Of Seasons & Ages, give me a full-on, original, top-down open-world game with this visual style.

(190, 4,N'In this first game, the story and switching between present day (circa 2007) and the past set in the Crusade era Holy Land is such an intriguing premise and the authenticity of the world and character design can be admired. That isn’t to say the game is the worst thing ever, but it truly is soooooooo tedious and repetitive that it’s tough to recommend. The parkour system is very cool and has a lot of attention to detail put into the running and climbing animations. Scaling towers and doing Leaps of Faiths is so fun which somewhat makes up for the overabundance of sync points. There are many other menial side missions that, while not lacking in variety, are just copy and pasted everywhere and it gets tiring very quickly. Play it if you’re curious as some of the stealth is fun (and a little more low key compared to later entires in the series), but don’t be surprised if it gets dull very quickly.',N'2025-02-24'),

É só ver que Prince of Persia fez mecânicas muito mais agradáveis, e que este deveria ser uma evolução pelo menos das escaladas, mas não é o que acontece. Basicamente o jogo não tem stealth, e isso matou a graça de muitas missões, pois você basicamente chega no inimigo e esfaqueia, depois aperta o botão para disfarçar. Me vi muitas vezes frustrado por ter de fazer missões repetitivas de assassinato onde tinham 3 alvos e se eu falhasse, ficava mais difícil porque os corpos dos que eu matei ainda estavam lá e os guardas ficavam em alerta, dificultando conseguir assassinar o alvo sem falhar, e as vezes os npcs (os loucos), simplesmente me empurravam, eu esbarrava em um guardsne falhava a missão.

I then played it again more recently, a couple of years ago to re-experience it and I love it. Ezio is the golden child of the series but Altair truly embodies the assassin in my mind infinitely better. Cold, calculating while still maintaining his humanity and code. I loved the city, running around and exploring while fighting enemies, but you definitely felt like there couldve been more tools to use in the game. I also really liked the Desmond sections, they had juuuussst enough mystery to them without being overwhelming.

Never before has a world felt as reactive as this, there is only one true instance where the world is not completely open ended to you, where the game of the year version has made progressing to the level 2 labs of VersaLife impossible to do before returning to Tong. Other than that, every area puts the ball in your court, if you can dream up a solution, chances are it can be done. NPCs, objectives, access to areas all remains seamless and alters accordingly. Pick up a key before talking to an NPC who tells you to go get it? Its not just that Denton will be quick to mention this, its the fact that you could potentially just walk past the NPC entirely and get the move on.

Some thoughts:\n                     \n                     - the world look fun and visually appealing but the dungeons were painfully bland.\n                     \n                     - I liked the artstyle for character portraits and backgrounds and the demons look good in battles but i do not like the character designs.\n                     \n                     - Happy to see some of the demons they included in the game, if a bit limited. It was odd seeing some demons show up at much higher level than usual but that doesn\t affect the experience of the game at all\n                     \n                     - The boss fights were fun. I played on Normal and I can imagine them being pretty challenging in other difficulties. The way they were structured made it really feel like you were fighting Devil Summoners. The challenge quests in the Soul Matrix were a highlight.\n                     \n                     - Honestly the story isn\t that bad. It has some questionable writing moments and you need to really convince yourself that Soul Hack-ing makes sense but if you get past that, it\s enjoyable. Forget everything you know about SMT: Soul Hackers though\n                     \n                     - My biggest gripe with it, the gameplay. It\s a fun loop, it didn\t outstay its welcome, but it\s not for me. I felt the same after playing TMS.

(223, 6,N'Here’s a pressing question for all you gamers under the age of thirty: do you actively avoid playing games from the pre-3D era because of their lack of availability, or because their foundation is comparatively primitive, and therefore jarringly inaccessible? The reason can’t be because these games are locked in an archival vault, for they are commonly ported to modern platforms. It must be due to the prevailing notion that video games have an arbitrary expiration date. C’mon, fess up. I’m not saying everyone born after the early 90s shares these predilections, but there seems to be a widespread viewpoint among younger gamers that vilifies games that predate their own conception, especially those of the early pixelated 2D period released before the late 1990s. A sneering distaste for the classics isn’t as pervasive with films or music. Zoomers will attend theater screenings of 2001: A Space Odyssey high as a kite and emphatically detail their “transcendental experience” to their peers with a Pulp Fiction poster in the background of their dorm rooms. No one is delusional enough to place the prequels or Disney Star Wars films over the immortal original trilogy regardless of their age. Maybe it’s because I spend too much time on the internet, but I’ve noticed that discovering older music artists via the world wide web is a more common practice among teenagers now than it was when I was in high school. Older video games, on the other hand, are treated with the same reaction of revulsion as if they were being forced to eat their brussels sprouts. Admittedly, as someone born in the early 3D era, many of the industry practices and comparatively primitive facets of game design can verge on being excruciating. I can count merely a handful of games that were released before I was born that are among my personal favorites, as there is only so much pain I can handle before my spirit shatters and I am in dire need of a relaxing bath with some chocolate ice cream for comfort. Conversely, there are plenty of those whose gaming prime was this jagged era, and the shift to 3D left them bewildered. They’ve assigned themselves to the role of gaming elder statesmen, whose repertoire is cryogenically frozen to the time before the medium became polygonal. After a certain point where the gaming industry reached a point of proficiency with 3D visuals to an almost cinematic extent, games that resembled those of the primeval pixelated years started popping out of the indie woodwork. One of the first breakout titles in this new wave of old-school revival games was Shovel Knight, a 2D side scroller that arguably bridged the generational gap of gamers.',N'2024-08-13'),

The A-type is your classic endless game of tetris, and the B-type involves clearing a certain amount of garbage blocks.

Moving blocks left to right is very slow and it feels like the blocks rotate in a way where I keep accidentally misplacing them. No hard drops either. I respect the people that play this competitively for learning how to master the controls, because I sure as hell had a hard time. Getting the ending of the game by clearing a level 9 speed 5 height B game is a total crap shoot due to the RNG of what blocks you get and the arrangement of the garbage blocks, so just stick to the A-game.

The voice acting is top tier, and James McCaffrey is the biggest reason for this success and is one of the best voice actors ever. The gameplay is unqiue and so satisfying, diving through the air as the world explodes around you and bullets whiz past you. The depiction of New York as this grim, snowy, crime-ridden land fits so well with the place and the cheesiness makes this so good. But I played this on the PC port, and the games crippling issues with the difficulty slider got annoying really quick. Walking through a door and getting insta-headshot three times and then the fourth time doing the same thing and not having it happen got annoying, and supposedly there is a major bug that makes it so the difficulty slider, which is tied to the only difficulty you can play at the start, is broken and doesnt properly balance the game. As well, some aspects feel a little too gamey in this serious tale, with a few levels sticking out like a sore thumb (the underground level). I feel enemy variety wasnt really a thing, just the same enemy that got stronger and stronger. But overall, this is a very good game with aspects that havent ever really been replicated as well, which is a shame. We need more top-tier, slow-mo shooters.',N'2025-04-27'),

I also wanted to be more competitive so I started like really grinding this game both online and offline, and really all I was doing was just burning myself out at an insane rate. This game series slowly stopped becoming the special highlight of get togethers and started becoming exhausting. I cant look back at this game in a positive light like I can for all the previous smash games before it because of that. Plus, smash games before this were unique enough from one another that theres enough reason to keep all the previous games around, whereas for this game, now that ultimates out, who the hell is still trying to play this?

(254, 6,N'To many this is the best game out of the entire Kingodm Hearts series, and to be fair theres a lot going for this game. As with many Square Enix games, they always deliver when it comes to music & overall aesthetics, especially when compared to KH1 & other Final Fantasy titles. The gameplay is greatly improved upon over Kingdom Hearts 1 in almost every regard: camera, movement, combat, platforming; everything that was good is better and everything that was bad is pretty much fixed. With that being said, this is where the story begins to take a nosedive in every direction. I personally skip all the cutscenses just to enjoy gameplay, which while great is very slow to pickup in the beginning due to the Roxas portion of the game. Without skipping cutscenes, its going to take a long time for the gameplay to come together into something really enjoyable.',N'2024-07-03'),
(254, 9,N'In my review of KH1 I remarked on how if I played these games as a kid they would have totally been my absolute favorites, mostly due to how the game had a sort of magical sense to it seeing as it was a Disney title. This game felt like it had a better fusion of both the whimsical magic that makes Disney titles shine as well as the more edgy anime-ass vibes that Square Enix was known for. Combined, those two elements make for a game that I feel if I had played as a kid, it would have changed things the same way Sonic Adventure 2 did for me. That right there is a powerful energy that I can only really say belongs to these two games and these two games alone. Unfortunately, I played this a little too late for it to have that kind of impact on me personally, but I absolutely recognize that power when I see it. The game pretty much improves upon the first in every way, with better locales, fancier and flashier gameplay, a more intricate plot, the whole nine yards. My only major gripe that I have with it is I think the second half could have been streamlined a bit better, and they could have made both acts for each world happen in a row rather than having you go through every world twice. Outside of that, this is a particularly special game. Which is certainly something I never thought Id say about a mfin game where a bunch of edgy cloaked dudes and mickey mouse share the same screen space.',N'2024-12-08'),

(255, 0,N'I remember back when this was a concept video, and was super intrigued by the gameplay mechanics. I\m glad that the game actually found a final version, and wasn\t just a concept with nothing done with it! As for the actual game itself, it was neat. I liked how they focused a lot on perspective based puzzles not only with the main gimmick of resizing objects based on perspective, but also with things like lighting and making 2D objects 3D, and resizing yourself to solve puzzles. However, there definitely were a lot of points where you are just walking through hallways, which felt like padding. It seems like while the game concept was really cool, there really wasn\t a lot you could properly do to put those cool mechanics into practice to make the game the next portal like everyone thought it would be when it was shown off. That being said, Portal is a really high bar, so not reaching that expectation does not a bad game make, since this game is still definitely worth playing IMO. The story focusing on having different perspectives was also neat and tied into the game mechanics, which was cool. All in all, it didn\t disappoint and I would recommend giving it a play!',N'2025-09-27'),
(255, 3,N'Up there with the Portal Series as one of the best puzzle games for me. I\m not one of the best or brightest and so having puzzles centered around one thing like portals or in this case, perspective, means that it\s not too difficult to figure out what you may want to do. Each puzzle is really cool obviously, the use of perspective to fiddle with objects is trippy and fun to just mess with. My personal favorite part of the game was the level design and the way it made you feel like you were spiraling ever deeper in a dream. From the endlessly carpeted halls of a hotel to spooky dimly lit backrooms I was on the edge of my seat on this ride. At the very climax of the game, when you have been spiraling ever deeper trapped in this dream, the entire thing is kind of thrown away. While the ending still works (avoiding too much for spoilers) it was a bit of a punch in the gut to go from OH MY GOD IM DYING to its all good its the end :).

(257, 1,N'The Persona series, along with its parent series Shin Megami Tensai, have generally been consistent with their themes throughout the years. The collective unconscious, the masks that people wear to conceal their true selves, and references to ancient Greek and Japanese mythology are all motifs that are usually present in SMT and Persona games. This has led to a consistently murky tone throughout the series, in the undertones when not overtly. While the darkest game in the series is up for debate, theres no debating which is the brightest: Persona 4. Released just 2 years after the decidedly grim Persona 3, and on the same engine, P4 delivers an overall joyful and optimistic tone that helped it stand out not only from its predecessor, but from previous Persona and SMT games as well. This may seem counter-intuitive, as the focus of the story is on finding a murder suspect who kills 2 people within hours of the games beginning. Yet its the moment-to-moment dialogue, the soundtrack, even the color palette (the yellow theme provides an overall sunny disposition) that makes Persona 4 not only a joyful experience, but a joy to experience.',N'2024-03-29'),

I beat this edition and played through most of the original as a kid, and I can say I never had strong memories about it aside from a few rooms. Beating it now after coming from other Kirby games, the game is plainly dated and I found myself rushing to just beat it after a while.\n                     \n                     The presentation is cute, the hybrid artstyle and cutscenes are nice to see, but as far as gameplay goes, SSU doesn\t do too much to add from the original — which I definitely have qualms over.\n                     \n                     Air movement is very sad in this game. Previous entries weren\t that great in this either, but it feels extremely noticable here. Jumps are not as pronounced (wheel still did not have this at the time, but felt like it could\ve been included),  flying (a major trait of Kirby) feels like such a pain in the ass that it\s better to avoid it over ground movement where possible, and many of the levels contain claustrophobic designs, sometimes cram-packed with enemies on top of hazard spam (either with lava or electricity as the main suspects) which all started to blur into one another instead of giving each place an overly distinct identity (aside from stages that were a 1-off gimmick). The worst part about this is that the amount of sources that inflict Heavy Knockdown to Kirby is very grinding, which only made me want to play more impatiently and roll my eyes when trying to brush away from a hazard ends up making you waste a few seconds, killing the pacing and action often. I assume the levels were left untouched from SS, but I feel like improvements could have been made to (at least) the level design. One-gap holes you must fall into, mazes galore and some other unintuitive puzzles (specific lava being passable when the rest isn\t) drowned my joy out.\n                     \n                     I don\t have much to say about the rest, everyone loves Marx and Galacta Knight. Meta Knightmare felt the most fun to play and control with the energy system being cool enough, but I don\t care too much about the minigame direction chosen. I personally prefer a centralized thing, and each segment didn\t make me feel like replaying it. I understand why they went this route, though.\n                     \n                     There is no bad Kirby game, and if managed to 97% the game then it was partially fun enough, but I have to give it my personal OK rating that made it a bit below Squeak Squad. Other games have more to offer and feel better to play, and all the hip and cool concepts of this game are mostly at the end of one\s playthrough to postpone playing it (if you\re not playing Kirbies in order).

(279, 5,N'Overall a great game. I only have a couple of complaints. The metroid hunting makes the game a little too linear, and the remake makes the areas of the game feel circular in design. The boss fights are way too tanky and some feel like they drag on forever. My final complaint is regard to Ridleys surprise appearance as the final boss. I love Ridley as much as the next guy, but Ridleys sudden appearance doesnt really fit the tone and atmosphere of the game. Its a cool and fun boss fight, but it should have ended with the queen metroid like in the original.',N'2024-04-28'),

The story choices, the ending, some of the decisions and such. But playing it now, all these years later with all the DLC I think it is amazing. I loved the combat, I loved seeing my cast of friends and all my actions add up, I loved how they expanded upon the reapers. And the Citadel DLC was... Wow. After binging 150-200 hours in Mass Effect 1 and 2 plus more of Mass Effect 3, playing this DLC was special. Being with all the companions I had, finally relaxed and seeing them happily talk to each other, remembering those that were lost... Thats what I think about when I hear the term Mass Effect. The companions. Best ones out there.

(304, 3,N'Dmc Devil may cry é um jogo bem sólido, com uma das melhores gameplays da série, e as melhores e mais divertidas seções de plataforma. A gameplay é muito boa, com muitos combos fluidos e variedade da armas , como parte fundamental dessa estrutura a troca rápida de armas durante um combo. Porém mesmo sendo um game muito gostoso de jogar , os inimigos não acompanham essa fluidez toda e acabam sendo na esmagadora maioria do jogo apenas sacos de pancadas de combos, o que abaixa e muito a dificuldade do game, o que pode desagradar alguns ( incluindo eu). No geral embora conte com um ou outro inimigo interessante, no geral os inimigos não tem metade do carisma da série principal, o que tbm se reflete um pouco nos poucos chefes do game, na qual  dois em especial são bem criativos e legais , porém os outros não tem o mesmo tempero que a série clássica. Quanto a história aoesar de um Reboot, dá pra perceber o cuidado de contar uma história de início mais consistente e uniforme, diferente da série principal que é uma bagunça tremenda na questão do enredo e cronologia. A história do jogo funciona passando um ar demoníaco mais sujo e pé no chão do que o padrão anime da série original, o que nesse jogo caiu muito bem. Porém acredito que o maior responsável pelo rage que esse jogo sofreu seja seu protagonista Dante, que não tem 20% do carisma do protagonista original, e somada a péssima estratégia de marketing usada na promoção desse jogo na época, apenas reforçaram a aversão ao personagem, o que infelizmente se refletiu na repercussão do game.

Players expecting a similar experience to previously mentioned games would be in for a big surprise, as this title lacked all the tropes you would expect in a typical RPG; no levels, no parties, no item shops, no grinding. Vagrant Story\s main appeal, at the time and currently, is its diversion from the norm of what RPGs were expected to be.

After all, the series is at its best when the break-neck excercise of going from minigame to minigame enters a strange zen of decision making mixed with speed and rythm, the charming characters adding deliciously to this recipe. Suddenly challenging a minigame is a matter of not only reacting and being familiar with it but of assesing how your character can approach the situation and how to use these tools for quick jolts of self expression and efficiency.\n                     \n                     While its hard to beat the party atmosphere of Smooth Moves, the absolute banquette of content that is Gold or the simple stroke of genius of the original, this title prooves itself worthy of being up there in the pantheon of clever and elegant game design that is the Wario Ware series.',N'2025-03-29'),

Matches, distinctive survival horror, and potato aim (due to Sebastian\s inherent human error, which some will complain about because if a game isn\t 100% efficient to the player\s skill it must be bad this is explicitly directed to people like CarcinogenSDA who have expressed horrid opinions about this game) are abandoned for half-baked exploration and an expanded story whose formulaic foundations can only be saved by the series\ great environmental and creature designs, particularly Camera Obscura. This is still a highly entertaining experience throughout to say the least. Enemies are less janky to deal with, and the gunplay/stealth, while easier, are more fun in general. Nevertheless, The Evil Within will remain one of survival horror\s defining successes in a decade where no one else was really making them until Capcom\s faithful return in 2017.

The end-game challenges, reminiscent of Wiley\s fortress and boss rushes after Megaman has fully self-actualized, were the highlight. Boss rushes in particular were fun to dissect and master.

In SMTIV at least, these were entirely optional and you had to purchase them. In Persona 5 Royal, they included the DLC, which again, I could ignore if they are optional, but I cant. Unlike in pervious games, there are legitimate fusions using legitimate personas that allow you to straight-up just get these P2W personas naturally, which I absolute fathom and throws the balance of the game out the window.\n                     \n                     -And more importantly, the entirety of Kasumis character pre-third semester (I want to punch her)',N'2024-07-06'),

However, I cannot say that Persona 5 is a bad game, although my experience with it was a bit rough. I had this state of waiting for something, like 5-10 hours more, and something incredible would happen for sure, characters pull off some weird moves and the real Persona (the one everyone is so hyped up about) would begin...

(353, 7,N'hmmmmmmm. Kind of a divisive one here for me personally. While I liked the characters, the plot felt kind of lacking and the connections to the other games in the series that were so hyped up by nintendo in marketing really didnt add to much, if anything. You could have replaced the references to the previous games with original stuff and nothing substantial would be different. In that aspect, this game was really disappointing. The villains were also an absolute joke, with the Mobius guys being the most generically boring guys in history and N being immensely less cool the more you learn about him. In terms of the gameplay though, it was certainly fun. The class system makes combat very customizable and I feel its absolutely possible to sink your teeth really into managing your party to get the most out of all your options. I also did a lot of side content in this game, which is uncharacteristic of me as I beelined it through the first two games. Exploration of the worlds is always fun in xenoblade games, and this is no exception. Perhaps I am just getting tired of the series, but this definitely didnt hit as much as the first or even the second game to me. Still would suggest to anyone that enjoyed the first two games because the gameplay is still fun but like yeaaaahh...',N'2025-02-14'),

My first attempt ended pretty swiftly since I didnt have a controller and the keyboard controls are... really bad! The game didnt quite jive with me at that point, but my main problem at that point was the hell that is cuphead with keyboard controls. A year or two later, I would play through the whole game, and later the DLC, in co-op with a friend. We did this over Steam so there was a bit of lag, but I had a controller and a friend to help me through. I enjoyed the game a lot more, to the point where I was the one pushing us to do the DLC together, but it still didnt quite enamour me like Id wanted it to. My main complaint at the time was the design of some of the bosses. I felt that a lot of them relied on being able to pay attention to cues and bullets coming from multiple parts of the screen, often with them all acting completely independently. I have a huge amount of trouble processing all of that information, so oftentimes I found bosses just far too overwhelming. Not a design issue or anything, more of a personal one.',N'2024-02-06'),

(362, 1,N'Loved this a lot. I missed the sense of exploration from Dark Souls, but the core action mechanics and satisfying parries more than made up for it. Other than a basic whole number for your damage and health, there\s no worrying about RPG values here. It\s a true action game taking place within the open-world Metroid-ish Souls structure, backed up with\n                     \n                      some\n                     \n                     items and buffs and junk if you decide to use them. But the lack of gear is probably the best thing about this - no armour sets, no elemental stats, no sword that deals +5 damage but -2 stamina. Funnily enough, people say this is the hardest FromSoftware game, but after a while it felt much, much easier to me than Dark Souls\n                     \n                      because\n                     \n                     there was nothing in my way except my own skill, which I greatly prefer. No main bosses that required some stupid consumable item for me to defeat properly. I don\t like feeling as if I need to grind to make myself better, because then it\s this vague guessing game of numbers. There were a few points in Dark Souls where I felt robbed of a boss fight because I must have been over-levelled, or I said screw it, summoned an NPC once and then steam-rolled the boss. No hollow victories here in Sekiro - although admittedly, once you get that perfect parry timing down, sometimes victory comes so fast that it\n                     \n                      almost\n                     \n                     feels unsatisfying.

(362, 4,N'It only took me three playthroughs but I finally like this game! Still has a lot of baffling decisions sprinkled throughout, though, which isn\t new for a Fromsoft game but this game is far more rigid in terms of there being a correct way to approach encounters so it only magnifies these issues when they appear. Soulsborne games (and ESPECIALLY Elden Ring) usually have a billion different ways you can break the game over your knee if something is really giving you trouble, but most of the time in Sekiro if the game throws something at you that\s bad and sucks you have to actually engage with the thing that\s bad and sucks, and that\s bad and sucks.',N'2024-07-17'),

(371, 2,N'I remember not thinking too much about the original RE2. Dont get me wrong, its a great game, but with REmake, RE3 and Code Veronica it was for me the weakest in the classic style saga. Then came this game in 2019. Holy fuck. Not only was this the first RE game I played on launch, but it just blew me away with how polished it was. The police station feels more real than ever, with dark and immersive areas that make you feel trapped and scared. The graphics also contribute to this, being incredibly realistic yet stylized, even if spme faces look a bit weird. I complained about how in the original RE playing as both characters wasnt worth it because the story barely changed, but thats completely fixed here. Not only do each of them have compelling and really different stories, but they also have different accessible rooms, gameplay segments and even final bosses. Another recurring problem with this franchise is that the best area is always the first one, and although thats also the case here, both the sewers and the lab are really fun and memorable in their own way.

Super fun to run around and the music is really nice. Glad to have a story where the characters take the events seriously without joking every 5 seconds. The story itself is ok, but the final act is clearly unfinished and rushed has probably one of the worst final bosses in the whole series which really undermines the ending a bit.

I’ve beaten it 5 times now (granted new game plus with all your upgrades and knowing where to go makes it much easier). I did find it to be very difficult at points and it can be somewhat easy to get lost. Also a vital system for progression can be too cryptic, but rewarding once you crack it. That’s about my only gripes. Must play game. Gorgeous artstyle, no handholdy nonsense, fun gameplay, top tier OST, great story, and an overall perfect action-adventure game.

(389, 9,N'Tunic is a wonderful 2D Zelda-like that feels like a love letter to the genre. Between an extremely charming aesthetic, fun and interesting items, and being extremely packed with puzzles and mystery, it would be hard not to recommend this game to any fan of the genre. The inclusions of things like a made up language and the instruction booklet all work to great effect to simulate that feeling you had when you were a kid trying to play a game like Links Awakening. Discovery is always well rewarded and always feel earned by the player. I feel as though there are very few handouts in terms of progression through the game, so even just simply navigating the world feels meaningful and accomplishing. Level design is top notch in this game and I love all the secrets and hidden paths they provide using the games isometric view. I think the weakest parts of this game compared to its contemporaries is the mood of the game.',N'2025-04-01'),

The era of Ninja Turtles that most intrest me like im sure many, is the 80s cartoon era. This game is a really cool time capsule of not only by playing into the iconic gameplay style of the time ( the Konami Ninja Turtle arcade games), but it perseveres most of the original voice actors, art style, referances and characters. The game almost can feel like a crash course to somebody like me who doesnt know much about the series, which I really apreciate. There are some really good tracks in this, most of which were composed by the Sonic Mania composer. The physical edition even came with a Pizza Hut coupon for a free personal pan pizza, which is incredible (I ate pizza pretty much every time I played this game).

Generally speaking, I enjoy playing stealth games with a controller. Stealth, like racing games, is a genre that benefits greatly from analog sticks. At the heart of a great stealth game is nail-biting tension and suspense. Vulnerability is stressed through risk outweighing reward. On a keyboard, all of your inputs are static. Are you pressing up? Good, you\re moving up. Jolting an analog stick up can mean the difference between shuffling silently and bringing in nearby ears for inspection. Even in games where this choice tends to be an illusion, it heightens the already high stakes of weaving in and out of crowded spaces as little more than a specter in the night.

Half the time youll be running around an empty level looking for that one door that gives you a yellow keycard with nothing in it, and the music is more like butchered versions of famous metal songs. The guns are great and the enemy design is rich and unique, but I really felt like they werent used to their full capability.

(423, 2,N'This is a collection of a bunch of vignettes that all play with JRPG tropes in unique ways, and for the most part I found these stories really unique and entertaining. This feels like the predecessor to Chrono Trigger in many ways, so fans of that game will immediately see similarities. It’s mostly a very accessible game, but my one big fault is that the game lets you choose any of these chapters to start with. Certain chapters I enjoyed within the context of the rest of the game, but are particularly unconventional and could make for a very weak first impression. Aside from that tho, I honestly loved this. Combat is a big standout for me, each encounter was like a mini tactics battle with a really fun grid system. I had to thoughtfully consider how to dispatch enemies effectively, and while it’s far from a difficult game, each battle had me engaged. Presentation is gorgeous with the HD-2D Switch remake, it’s a total overhaul that still remains faithful to the original. While some chapters are definitely weaker than others, I thoroughly enjoyed the majority of my time with this game. And while I won’t spoil the final segments that come after you finish the seven main chapters, I found them to be so fun and satisfying that they elevate the entire experience. This definitely deserves to be considered a classic of the era right alongside FFVI and Chrono Trigger.',N'2024-05-14'),

(423, 9,N'Honestly, there just wasnt enough here to keep me engaged. Most of the chapters dont encourage exploration, the combat is lackluster with little to no skill involved, and the characters are underwhelming on the whole with very little emotional impact. The space episode was the best one that I got to, and even that had me rolling my eyes at some points. I expect more from RPGs, even remasters of old classics.

(429, 0,N'I really enjoyed this one. The story is super interesting, most characters are multi-layered and more complex than they initially seem, and how this game handles skills and thoughts is genius. As most reviews for this game have said, its really great that failing a skill check does not necessarily mean youre now going through a worse version of the game (in some cases its even a more fun route). The politics and wordbuilding are also super deep and will really please those who enjoy those topics in their media.  I personally found myself more engrossed by the games study of the main character, who was as awful and destructive as he was likeable and relatable. I also found it incredible how the writers have managed to give him his own personality while also allowing a huge amount of his character to be determined by the player. Normally games tend to present one of these two archetypes for their main character, but this mixture of both helps a lot in giving the player a much deeper connection with the character while also allowing the character to serve the main themes of the story.\n                     \n                     On that note, the amount of choices they give you for customizing him are insane, and they really dont feel overwhelming despite there being multiple methods to change your character.

Em um misto de momentos de ação, angústia, nervosismo e fúria, a obra consegue entregar aquilo que promete e muito mais, conseguindo explicar os pontos que foram propostos a serem explicados ao mesmo tempo que deixa pontas soltas para sua sequência, A Plague Tale: Requiem',N'2024-07-17'),

(456, 9,N'Artistically, I love this game. The island setting is really refreshing and Koholint is so lovely to just exist in. The dreamlike nature of the narrative is super different for Zelda and the way it all wraps up at the end is so nice, finally meeting the Wind Fish, waking up, hearing Marins song. Beautiful. And the visual style? Oh my god. I adore how this game looks so much, I want every game to look like this. It is so, so full of charm and colour and personality. Give me a Mario game that looks like this, give me a Pokemon game that looks like this, give me a fuckin GTA game that looks like this!! Genuinely what I would love more than anything else in the world is for the Zelda series - after Tears Of The Kingdom to come back to this style for the next mainline game. Dont just keep this relegated to remakes if you do Oracle Of Seasons & Ages, give me a full-on, original, top-down open-world game with this visual style. Drop me in a place as beautiful and mysterious as Koholint, tell me very little and let me discover it all on my own.',N'2024-11-02'),

(457, 10,N'In this first game, the story and switching between present day (circa 2007) and the past set in the Crusade era Holy Land is such an intriguing premise and the authenticity of the world and character design can be admired. That isn’t to say the game is the worst thing ever, but it truly is soooooooo tedious and repetitive that it’s tough to recommend. The parkour system is very cool and has a lot of attention to detail put into the running and climbing animations. Scaling towers and doing Leaps of Faiths is so fun which somewhat makes up for the overabundance of sync points. There are many other menial side missions that, while not lacking in variety, are just copy and pasted everywhere and it gets tiring very quickly. Play it if you’re curious as some of the stealth is fun (and a little more low key compared to later entires in the series), but don’t be surprised if it gets dull very quickly.',N'2024-02-26'),
(457, 2,N'Sinceramente, eu não curti. Sei que é o primeiro jogo e que as mecânicas ainda eram um rascunho, mas, caramba, é torturante escalar, o combate não tem diversidade nenhuma e o protagonista, apesar de interessante, não tem quase nada de carisma, sempre falando em tom neutro e sem expressar emoção.\n                     \n                     Para um início, mesmo levando em conta as limitações, ainda é bem fraco. É só ver que Prince of Persia fez mecânicas muito mais agradáveis, e que este deveria ser uma evolução pelo menos das escaladas, mas não é o que acontece. Basicamente o jogo não tem stealth, e isso matou a graça de muitas missões, pois você basicamente chega no inimigo e esfaqueia, depois aperta o botão para disfarçar. Me vi muitas vezes frustrado por ter de fazer missões repetitivas de assassinato onde tinham 3 alvos e se eu falhasse, ficava mais difícil porque os corpos dos que eu matei ainda estavam lá e os guardas ficavam em alerta, dificultando conseguir assassinar o alvo sem falhar, e as vezes os npcs (os loucos), simplesmente me empurravam, eu esbarrava em um guardsne falhava a missão.

I then played it again more recently, a couple of years ago to re-experience it and I love it. Ezio is the golden child of the series but Altair truly embodies the assassin in my mind infinitely better. Cold, calculating while still maintaining his humanity and code. I loved the city, running around and exploring while fighting enemies, but you definitely felt like there couldve been more tools to use in the game. I also really liked the Desmond sections, they had juuuussst enough mystery to them without being overwhelming.

There’s lots of neat level designs and environments that caught me off guard, and were very enjoyable to play.

My main issue is that it is a roguelike, but it doesnt have any replabilitiy.

But you cant really control or change builds to have drastically different play styles. Youre still dodging and shooting with an active reload for the most part and that is it, with the variety coming from the enemies and biomes.

I can\t say it\s as bad as people make it out to be - maybe it\s because I\ve experience some of the truly worst megaten games so I\m desensitized to poor quality but I\ve had fun. Some thoughts:\n                     \n                     - the world look fun and visually appealing but the dungeons were painfully bland.\n                     \n                     - I liked the artstyle for character portraits and backgrounds and the demons look good in battles but i do not like the character designs.\n                     \n                     - Happy to see some of the demons they included in the game, if a bit limited.

The challenge quests in the Soul Matrix were a highlight.\n                     \n                     - Honestly the story isn\t that bad. It has some questionable writing moments and you need to really convince yourself that Soul Hack-ing makes sense but if you get past that, it\s enjoyable.

(490, 2,N'Here’s a pressing question for all you gamers under the age of thirty: do you actively avoid playing games from the pre-3D era because of their lack of availability, or because their foundation is comparatively primitive, and therefore jarringly inaccessible? The reason can’t be because these games are locked in an archival vault, for they are commonly ported to modern platforms. It must be due to the prevailing notion that video games have an arbitrary expiration date. C’mon, fess up. I’m not saying everyone born after the early 90s shares these predilections, but there seems to be a widespread viewpoint among younger gamers that vilifies games that predate their own conception, especially those of the early pixelated 2D period released before the late 1990s. A sneering distaste for the classics isn’t as pervasive with films or music. Zoomers will attend theater screenings of 2001: A Space Odyssey high as a kite and emphatically detail their “transcendental experience” to their peers with a Pulp Fiction poster in the background of their dorm rooms. No one is delusional enough to place the prequels or Disney Star Wars films over the immortal original trilogy regardless of their age. Maybe it’s because I spend too much time on the internet, but I’ve noticed that discovering older music artists via the world wide web is a more common practice among teenagers now than it was when I was in high school. Older video games, on the other hand, are treated with the same reaction of revulsion as if they were being forced to eat their brussels sprouts. Admittedly, as someone born in the early 3D era, many of the industry practices and comparatively primitive facets of game design can verge on being excruciating. I can count merely a handful of games that were released before I was born that are among my personal favorites, as there is only so much pain I can handle before my spirit shatters and I am in dire need of a relaxing bath with some chocolate ice cream for comfort. Conversely, there are plenty of those whose gaming prime was this jagged era, and the shift to 3D left them bewildered. They’ve assigned themselves to the role of gaming elder statesmen, whose repertoire is cryogenically frozen to the time before the medium became polygonal. After a certain point where the gaming industry reached a point of proficiency with 3D visuals to an almost cinematic extent, games that resembled those of the primeval pixelated years started popping out of the indie woodwork. One of the first breakout titles in this new wave of old-school revival games was Shovel Knight, a 2D side scroller that arguably bridged the generational gap of gamers.',N'2024-03-13'),

These types of RPG Maker horror games usually get a bad rap; they are often cheap products made by inexperienced designers who believe that mashing teenage girl protagonists with horrific set pieces will instantly make a work profound. Yume Nikki does not deserve to be lumped in with the contemporaries. Kikiyama, the developer, managed to extract clever narrative meaning within the bounds of RPG Makers limited toolset in a way that left me genuinely floored.

(510, 1,N'Max Payne is such a good game with some crippling problems that really date it. The voice acting is top tier, and James McCaffrey is the biggest reason for this success and is one of the best voice actors ever. The gameplay is unqiue and so satisfying, diving through the air as the world explodes around you and bullets whiz past you. The depiction of New York as this grim, snowy, crime-ridden land fits so well with the place and the cheesiness makes this so good. But I played this on the PC port, and the games crippling issues with the difficulty slider got annoying really quick. Walking through a door and getting insta-headshot three times and then the fourth time doing the same thing and not having it happen got annoying, and supposedly there is a major bug that makes it so the difficulty slider, which is tied to the only difficulty you can play at the start, is broken and doesnt properly balance the game. As well, some aspects feel a little too gamey in this serious tale, with a few levels sticking out like a sore thumb (the underground level). I feel enemy variety wasnt really a thing, just the same enemy that got stronger and stronger. But overall, this is a very good game with aspects that havent ever really been replicated as well, which is a shame. We need more top-tier, slow-mo shooters.',N'2024-01-14'),

Youd think all of that would combine to make a very frustrating and not fun mario kart game, but honestly the opposite is true. Its honestly fun to just get absolutely destroyed because the game didnt like you that round, in a cathartic sense. Theres no music that plays when more than 2 people are in splitscreen though which makes the game kinda feel empty ngl, just play some of your own music over it instead I guess.

(527, 3,N'A southern gothic science fiction adventure game taking place as the protagonist Kay returns to her hometown in a post Civil War US amid worldwide catastrophes in order to find her brother after your mothers death from cancer. New Orleans is an industrial dystopia overseen by the Shield Chemical corporation (a stand in for Shell Oil that is in the real life area) and as you explore more you learn about a mysterious client your mother was working for and the different people that had taken an interest in her. The lead occasionally shifts to the recent past where you play as Kays mother. Norco has little focus on traditional adventure puzzle solving where you mostly find and combine items and instead will often give you multiple ways to handle a problem, minor turn based QTE and memory based combat, text adventure scenes, driving a boat in a swamp set in an alligator hand puppets poetry.

I probably dont have to think too hard as to why it took me so long since I had heard a lot of negative things about the game, which I now realise was from a lot of AC fans feeling spurned by the new direction. Despite enjoying Origins, I wasnt chomping at the bit to play an iterative sequel. So yes, thats why I waited so long but Im glad Ive played it now since I adore it. Origins was mostly an action adventure game with some RPG mechanics which incidentally describes most games these days. Ultimately, the RPG side of the game wasnt particularly substantial while it watered down the fun stealth action and parkour from earlier entries in the series.\n                     \n                     Assassins Creed Odyssey is absolutely an RPG though.

(531, 8,N'Action games generally operate on the concept of player empowerment, granting the tools to overcome any challenge without a scratch, as long as players have the skill to realize that potential. Meanwhile, horror games operate on the concept of player\n                     \n                      disempowerment\n                     \n                     , giving the bare minimum in order to foster a tense atmosphere, so balancing the priorities of each genre seems like mixing oil and water. Resident Evil games are famous for trying to do so, but they usually break into a horror-centric first half and an action-centric back half, without a true blending of the concepts. The Evil Within meanwhile actually managed it, but had to alienate players in some key ways in order to do so. Firstly, the logic behind the story is nearly impossible to follow at first, leaving players unable to find their footing, confused at why the progression is so jumpy and unfocused. Then, the mechanical restrictions feel like they’re equally arbitrary: Sebastian can only initially carry about twelve bullets, and not even a full healthbar’s worth of recovery. He can barely run at all, and in order to alleviate any of this, you may have to bank up green gel over the course of multiple chapters. It can seem like the game is simply trying to make action feel scary by stressing out players with cheap deaths, but once you commit to learning the game, a brilliant method behind the madness reveals itself. While the story\n                     \n                      is\n                     \n                     mostly nonsense, the abstract nature of it allows for level design suited to a wide variety of challenges. With new mechanics being introduced at a steady pace, players are constantly kept on the backfoot, and thus disempowered, even as their growing mechanical knowledge empowers them. The shallow capacity for supplies is an obvious form of disempowerment which prompts players to spend resources cleverly, but their abundance between each fight empowers players to use their entire toolkit freely. The upgrade system empowers; the below-par baselines make unupgraded stats more of a problem in the face of scaling challenge. For every give, there’s a take, and thus, a harmony between action and horror is reached. As stated before though, the “take” for that brilliance is a frontloaded sense of disempowerment, with players having to get through most of the game before they’ve experienced enough character growth and skill development to redress the balance. So, I really can’t blame anyone for bouncing off of this game, but I also truly believe that as of today (less than a week away from RE4 remake), it’s the best merging of action and horror in gaming. Resident Evil 4 is pure satisfying action, Dead Space commits to bloody horror, but The Evil Within is purely… both.',N'2024-11-02'),

Bom, essa mistura existe, e se chama Metal: Hellsinger. Se você já jogou Doom alguma vez na sua vida, provavelmente já reparou que um dos pontos fortes da saga são suas trilhas sonoras marcantes que conseguem tornar a experiência de cortar demônios ainda mais prazerosa.\n                     \n                     Pensando nisso, a desenvolvedora The Outsiders resolveu criar sua própria versão do clássico de 1993, porém com a adição de uma mecânica um pouco diferente. Ritmo. A gameplay de Metal: Hellsinger se baseia em realizar as ações tradicionais de um jogo de tiro (Atirar, pular, esquivar, recarregar) porém tudo sincronizado com a música.\n                     \n                     No centro da tela ao lado da mira do jogador, existe um marcador com o BPM da música, o objetivo é realizar as ações do jogo dentro do tempo. Quanto mais preciso você atira, mais dano e pontos você faz. Uma das partes que eu mais achei interessante no jogo, é seu objetivo, aqui, seu objetivo não é só completar a fase, mas também, fazer a maior pontuação possível.\n                     \n                     Ao todo o jogo possui 10 capítulos, cada capítulo termina com uma Boss Fight e ao completá-lo, outros 3 desafios são liberados no mesmo cenário. Em questão de tempo de gameplay, o jogo é relativamente curto podendo ser fechado em cerca de 5 horas, porém esse tempo pode se estender caso você esteja em busca do 100%.\n                     \n                     A história do jogo é simples, porém o suficiente para um bom plano de fundo de um tiroteio infernal.

Em sua jornada você deve destruir hordas de demônios e seus líderes para enfim travar um combate com a Juíza e recuperar a voz que lhe foi roubada.\n                     \n                     Mas vamos falar do que interessa, a trilha sonora. A música é o ponto alto do jogo, e como é de se esperar, ela é impecavel. O jogo conta com 15 músicas autorais escritas e compostas exclusivamente para o título. A melhor parte é que cada música conta com a participação especial de grandes nomes do metal internacional. Entre os artistas convidados estão Alissa White-Gluz (Arch Enemy), Mikael Stanne (Dark Tranquility), Tatiana Shmayluk (Jinjer), Serj Tankian (System of a Down), além de outros grandes nomes, totalizando 9 artistas convidados.\n                     \n                     As músicas são muito boas e qualquer um terá uma experiência agradável jogando, porém é claro, elas se tornam muito mais prazerosas para aqueles que não só já gostam do gênero, mas também para aqueles que já escutavam os artistas convidados previamente.\n                     \n                     Os pontos altos do jogo obviamente são focados na música e no gameplay. A trilha sonora acompanha perfeitamente o tiroteio frenético da jornada através do inferno, e a experiência se torna mais prazerosa com o sistema de ritmo fazendo com que você tenha que acertar tiros, esquivas e recargas no tempo da música. Também é bom citar como ponto positivo o fato dele estar disponível gratuitamente no Xbox Game Pass.\n                     \n                     Não tem muitos pontos negativos no jogo, mas se for pra citar algum, talvez seja interessante citar o tempo de gameplay, que em uma zerada apenas pode ser muito curto e não compensar os R$99 reais investidos.

I also wanted to be more competitive so I started like really grinding this game both online and offline, and really all I was doing was just burning myself out at an insane rate. This game series slowly stopped becoming the special highlight of get togethers and started becoming exhausting. I cant look back at this game in a positive light like I can for all the previous smash games before it because of that. Plus, smash games before this were unique enough from one another that theres enough reason to keep all the previous games around, whereas for this game, now that ultimates out, who the hell is still trying to play this?

(541, 9,N'To many this is the best game out of the entire Kingodm Hearts series, and to be fair theres a lot going for this game. As with many Square Enix games, they always deliver when it comes to music & overall aesthetics, especially when compared to KH1 & other Final Fantasy titles. The gameplay is greatly improved upon over Kingdom Hearts 1 in almost every regard: camera, movement, combat, platforming; everything that was good is better and everything that was bad is pretty much fixed. With that being said, this is where the story begins to take a nosedive in every direction. I personally skip all the cutscenses just to enjoy gameplay, which while great is very slow to pickup in the beginning due to the Roxas portion of the game. Without skipping cutscenes, its going to take a long time for the gameplay to come together into something really enjoyable.',N'2025-04-13'),
(541, 1,N'In my review of KH1 I remarked on how if I played these games as a kid they would have totally been my absolute favorites, mostly due to how the game had a sort of magical sense to it seeing as it was a Disney title. This game felt like it had a better fusion of both the whimsical magic that makes Disney titles shine as well as the more edgy anime-ass vibes that Square Enix was known for. Combined, those two elements make for a game that I feel if I had played as a kid, it would have changed things the same way Sonic Adventure 2 did for me. That right there is a powerful energy that I can only really say belongs to these two games and these two games alone. Unfortunately, I played this a little too late for it to have that kind of impact on me personally, but I absolutely recognize that power when I see it. The game pretty much improves upon the first in every way, with better locales, fancier and flashier gameplay, a more intricate plot, the whole nine yards. My only major gripe that I have with it is I think the second half could have been streamlined a bit better, and they could have made both acts for each world happen in a row rather than having you go through every world twice. Outside of that, this is a particularly special game. Which is certainly something I never thought Id say about a mfin game where a bunch of edgy cloaked dudes and mickey mouse share the same screen space.',N'2025-04-02'),

(542, 10,N'I remember back when this was a concept video, and was super intrigued by the gameplay mechanics. I\m glad that the game actually found a final version, and wasn\t just a concept with nothing done with it! As for the actual game itself, it was neat. I liked how they focused a lot on perspective based puzzles not only with the main gimmick of resizing objects based on perspective, but also with things like lighting and making 2D objects 3D, and resizing yourself to solve puzzles. However, there definitely were a lot of points where you are just walking through hallways, which felt like padding. It seems like while the game concept was really cool, there really wasn\t a lot you could properly do to put those cool mechanics into practice to make the game the next portal like everyone thought it would be when it was shown off. That being said, Portal is a really high bar, so not reaching that expectation does not a bad game make, since this game is still definitely worth playing IMO. The story focusing on having different perspectives was also neat and tied into the game mechanics, which was cool. All in all, it didn\t disappoint and I would recommend giving it a play!',N'2025-06-27'),
(542, 9,N'Up there with the Portal Series as one of the best puzzle games for me. I\m not one of the best or brightest and so having puzzles centered around one thing like portals or in this case, perspective, means that it\s not too difficult to figure out what you may want to do. Each puzzle is really cool obviously, the use of perspective to fiddle with objects is trippy and fun to just mess with. My personal favorite part of the game was the level design and the way it made you feel like you were spiraling ever deeper in a dream. From the endlessly carpeted halls of a hotel to spooky dimly lit backrooms I was on the edge of my seat on this ride. At the very climax of the game, when you have been spiraling ever deeper trapped in this dream, the entire thing is kind of thrown away. While the ending still works (avoiding too much for spoilers) it was a bit of a punch in the gut to go from OH MY GOD IM DYING to its all good its the end :).

(544, 6,N'The Persona series, along with its parent series Shin Megami Tensai, have generally been consistent with their themes throughout the years. The collective unconscious, the masks that people wear to conceal their true selves, and references to ancient Greek and Japanese mythology are all motifs that are usually present in SMT and Persona games. This has led to a consistently murky tone throughout the series, in the undertones when not overtly. While the darkest game in the series is up for debate, theres no debating which is the brightest: Persona 4. Released just 2 years after the decidedly grim Persona 3, and on the same engine, P4 delivers an overall joyful and optimistic tone that helped it stand out not only from its predecessor, but from previous Persona and SMT games as well. This may seem counter-intuitive, as the focus of the story is on finding a murder suspect who kills 2 people within hours of the games beginning. Yet its the moment-to-moment dialogue, the soundtrack, even the color palette (the yellow theme provides an overall sunny disposition) that makes Persona 4 not only a joyful experience, but a joy to experience.',N'2024-01-10'),

Its probably the worst Halo, a painfully mediocre shooter with a terrible story. But I dont find it completely out of line with the rest of the series, which is damming of my opinion of Halo as a whole.  Halo 4 isnt the worst modern shooter, but unless you have a burning desire to play through the entire franchise like I have had, its not even remotely close to worth your time.',N'2024-09-11'),

(556, 9,N'Mega Man 2 basically took everything good about the first game, polished it and improved it in every way imaginable with more refined controls, less slippery platforming, much better stage design, iconic boss fights that provide decent challenge, more variety in the obtainable powers and improved difficulty balancing alongside another incredible banger of a soundtrack.

None of the characters were very interesting, but my least favorite was easily the protagonist, because on top of the obviously bad idea of making him be part of a fictional Native American tribe, Delsin Rowe was also just annoying, as his constant quips and one-liners consistently got on my nerves.',N'2025-03-02'),
(558, 10,N'This game is what validated my PS4 back when it came out. Visually it still looks great with a lot of good lighting and particle effects. Either that or Im still just easy to please. The plot is pretty cool too, as you play as some rebel dude tryin to overthrow the authority with his elemental powers. As your character can steal elemental powers from other people, theres a lot of different abilities you can use and can switch from element to element on the fly so thats cool.

I beat this edition and played through most of the original as a kid, and I can say I never had strong memories about it aside from a few rooms. Beating it now after coming from other Kirby games, the game is plainly dated and I found myself rushing to just beat it after a while.\n                     \n                     The presentation is cute, the hybrid artstyle and cutscenes are nice to see, but as far as gameplay goes, SSU doesn\t do too much to add from the original — which I definitely have qualms over.\n                     \n                     Air movement is very sad in this game. Previous entries weren\t that great in this either, but it feels extremely noticable here. Jumps are not as pronounced (wheel still did not have this at the time, but felt like it could\ve been included),  flying (a major trait of Kirby) feels like such a pain in the ass that it\s better to avoid it over ground movement where possible, and many of the levels contain claustrophobic designs, sometimes cram-packed with enemies on top of hazard spam (either with lava or electricity as the main suspects) which all started to blur into one another instead of giving each place an overly distinct identity (aside from stages that were a 1-off gimmick). The worst part about this is that the amount of sources that inflict Heavy Knockdown to Kirby is very grinding, which only made me want to play more impatiently and roll my eyes when trying to brush away from a hazard ends up making you waste a few seconds, killing the pacing and action often. I assume the levels were left untouched from SS, but I feel like improvements could have been made to (at least) the level design. One-gap holes you must fall into, mazes galore and some other unintuitive puzzles (specific lava being passable when the rest isn\t) drowned my joy out.\n                     \n                     I don\t have much to say about the rest, everyone loves Marx and Galacta Knight. Meta Knightmare felt the most fun to play and control with the energy system being cool enough, but I don\t care too much about the minigame direction chosen. I personally prefer a centralized thing, and each segment didn\t make me feel like replaying it. I understand why they went this route, though.\n                     \n                     There is no bad Kirby game, and if managed to 97% the game then it was partially fun enough, but I have to give it my personal OK rating that made it a bit below Squeak Squad. Other games have more to offer and feel better to play, and all the hip and cool concepts of this game are mostly at the end of one\s playthrough to postpone playing it (if you\re not playing Kirbies in order). An alright game to spend an afternoon on.',N'2024-03-13'),

(575, 9,N'I was worried that the retirement of Nathan would leave Uncharted without anything to carry a story, as I never considered Chloe a very interesting character in 2. Thankfully, Lost Legacy compensates nicely with a shorter story, that doesnt ask too much of the player while still hitting all the correct beats. The gameplay improvements made in 4 make a triumphant return, though the climbing is still annoying. Each big set-piece is dynamic and exciting, the game never lingers too long or moves on too quickly. On the open-zone section in the beginning I have conflicted feelings. On one hand, the dialouge between Chloe and Nadine is charming and entertaining without feeling too artificial, and I enjoyed the scenery. However, this series has always been about maintaining momentum. I now have a newfound appreciation for the sublime pacing of the older games, after experiencing what it feels like to lose that forward-moving feeling. The game definietly picks up the tempo again afterwards, but I cant say the section left a good impression overall. The rest of the game is exactly as one would expect. The villain is nothing special, the platforming is cool and rhytmic, but not very complex, and there arent really any themes to delve into beyond the absolute minimum stuff. I dont mind though, I am satisfied with the game being a nice adventure to relax with, a role it easily fulfills.',N'2025-07-04'),

Neil Druckmann gives you a  modest american movie, but as a videogame he gives the most generic story possible and fails to write Chloe as a charismatic protagonist - he transformed her in another Nathan Drake -. Every action scene is copied from another Uncharted game and the structure add nothing to mechanics and functionality. The villain is bland and the male characters are there to fill the misandry quota. All the merits of this game still belongs to Uncharted 1,2 and 3. Play only if you want a little movie experience, or watch the cutscenes on YouTube.',N'2024-12-09'),
(575, 4,N'Everyone told me that Uncharted was a videogame franchise with no bad games, well what do you call this garbage then?  The Story is that Chloe hires Nadine (from the fourth game) to help her retrieve a ancient Indian artifact, this is an odd idea for a story, because Chloe knows about Nadine\s history with her friends Nathan and Sam Drake, yet she works with someone who hates them, and doesn\t think she will turn on her, and when she finds out that Sam was helping out, Nadine feels betrayed, assaults Chloe, and abandons her, until she apologizes, but Nadine says that she is now only helping Chloe out for the treasure, but don\t worry, she gets over it randomly after they help a trapped elephant, it happens so fast that there isn\t even a moment where Nadine is completely over it, she randomly is, and they both act like it never happened, because the writing is terrible, when it comes to the character moments, and after they are trapped with Sam, him and Nadine both argue a lot, because of their history, but when interacting, Chloe trusts the girl who assaulted her and tried to kill her former lover, and his brother, more than she trusts her former lover\s brother, which feels like Feminism, where the two girls get along, where as the man is played for a foil to it, which is frowned upon in this, and since Nadine never shows any remorse for what she did in the last game to the protagonist, and Sam does, it makes Nadine even less likeable than she already was, and ruins the story completely, and studios need to stop this garbage.  The Characters are no where near as good as their last previous appearances, thanks to Chloe being sympathetic to a former villain over a man, Nadine worsened by trying to make us like her, by being an unlikeable villain to hero tale, without even regretting her actions, and made Sam to feel more of a nuisance than a main character, to the point where he doesn\t even bring his own grapple hook (even though he would never do that), stop writing feminism over male\s feelings in games, and shame the people who think otherwise, the villain is barely anymore interesting than the first game\s main villain, with his history with an old kingdom, but it doesn\t go beyond that, and I enjoyed the traits of the second game\s main villain more.  The Graphics are as good as the remastered versions of the first 3 games, with some moments are awe (the best being when you run off a train heading off a broken bridge, even if the second game\s train scene was much better), but no where near as good as the fourth game, and not as many memorable moments to be on par with games 2 and 3, they have better looking events than the first game though.  The Gameplay is the same as before, only shorter to the point where it\s less than half the length of games 2, 3, and 4, and in chapter 4, you can optionally find coins to retrieve a ruby bracelet, but no other moments like it make it feel random, silenced pistols were a great addition, but chapters 5, and especially 4 feel far too long, and could have been shortened, to make 2 more chapters, especially with how big you have to travel for completing chapter 4 is.  The Music is not as memorable as before due to less moments to have them takeover the scene for atmosphere, and the song at the end Borders, by M.I.A is a bland and forgettable song.

I remember booting the game on easy, shooting the first zombie or two with the assault riflt, and being so scared that I couldnt play it. A few years later I actually beat it and I enjoyed it but not as much as the second. The dodge was cool but way too frustrating to use, and while I loved exploring the city I think that the second half isnt as strong because it is basically the same thing as the other two games. Sewers and Lab. I also didnt really like Carlos too much honestly and found him annoying, and I was also missing the city in chaos part.

Nemesis is cool though, I like the funny zombie guy. I wish he showed up more frequently and stalked you all throughout the map, but the times he does show up can be exciting, and the man runs at you like a football player which is awesome. All in all, the game is definitely memorable and worth checking out if you like resident evil stuff, but it is definitely the most flawed and occasionally frustrating game of the classic style, so beware.',N'2024-10-30'),

Regardless of your opinion of the state of the meta in this game or in the OCG, it is easily the most accessible way to experience the mechanics that have been added over the years. Easy to keep track of yours and your opponents graveyard and banished cards, easy to keep track of what the effects of yours and your opponents cards do, and basically not have to deal with any of the BS that would come with dueling with someone that is using an archetype that you havent played against before or not being up to date with the rules of the card game in real life. Its also the least expensive way to experience the game. As a programmer, I also very much appreciate what had to be taken to account how all these cards should interact with each other and always work how they are supposed to exactly like following the effect of the cards and rules if you were to duel in real life, all the while the game being smooth and not very resource hungry.

The concept is addicting but I believe the true reason why this game popped off hard was due to its character. No longer were you shooting aliens in a generic spaceship, you were a character with a name getting chased by other characters with names and even their own personalities. I dont know if this was the first game EVER to do such a thing (probably not), but it was the first to do it and really explode in popularity. The power dynamic flipping whenever you get a power pellet is also a pretty cartoony mechanic in its own right which makes the game just have this cartoonish charm.

The thing about the NSMB games is that they arent bad they are just painfully generic, so its good at the very least to see nintendo TRY to do something different with the formula, even if it was something as shallow as making the game full of coins.',N'2024-03-14'),

(611, 1,N'Marvel Snap was the biggest surprise of 2022. I have never been a fan of card game portions of games. Less than 5 hours of my life as Geralt was spent on Gwent, triple triad in FFXIV does nothing for me and I actively despised Joustus in king of cards. Im also not a big fan of mobile games as they are typically shallow affairs that never hold my attention. So for Marvel snap to be my most played game to release in 2022 and a near ever-present in my daily life, they must have got something right. The key to marvel snap is that its easy to pick up and hard to master. Each card is both a part of marvels illustrious history and a chess piece that can change the game if used correctly. A game of marvel snap lasts less than 5 minutes so its easy to justify trying different combination of cards as picking cards with poor synergy will not cost you much. The process of developing  wining decks is as satisfying as learning the ropes in any fighting game. The games various locations that impact each match only add to the complexity as you alter your strategy based on there affects as well as your opponents moves. The snap is a genius mechanic that forces you to either call there bluff or fold like its a high stake poker game.  The ability to upgrade your cards, so they are 3D holographic brings back childhood memories , alongside giving the game a engaging gameplay loop. Upgrading your cards, daily challenges and season challenges keep me coming back day after day.  Not being able to buy unique cards is one of the best decisions the devs ever made and allows me to come back day after day unlocking new cards, getting a holographic card collection my childhood self could only dream of and switching between strategies to keep the game fresh is a wining formula  where the marvel licence is only  the cherry on top of a delicious cake.',N'2024-08-22'),
(611, 0,N'A card game with simple mechanics. Easy to get into difficult to master. Youll be surprised how many diverse decks you can come up with, with ass simple cards this game offers. Each match takes about 2 minutes or so and every match feels unique enough to keep you engaged in its core gameplay loop.',N'2025-02-14'),
(611, 6,N'Marvel Snap is a bit like Destiny 2, Apex Legends, and many others in the “game as a service” category: a great game you probably shouldn’t play.\n                     \n                     There is no denying that Marvel Snap is astoundingly great at being a quick and flashy 2-player card battler: card effects are superbly designed, so that almost every cards feels powerful and great to play; decks are exactly 12 cards, so it’s easy to deckbuild, experiment, and try many different strategies; and, at exactly 6 turns, each game is snappy I got used to firing up the matchmaking every time I have to go downstairs to grab a food delivery — and I live in the second story on my building. Win or lose, you’ll play your cards, watch their flashy effects, and have your dopamine hit. It really does feel great.\n                     \n                     Not to mention one of the best parts of the design, the titular snapping mechanic: with one tap, you can stake your progression with a “double or nothing” gamble. No matter if you’re really confident or just bluffing, the other player either needs to call it or concede defeat. This creates tension like a motherfucker.\n                     \n                     So let me get this straight, you’re thinking. Snap looks stunning, is polished to a shine, and feels genuinely great to play. What’s the problem?\n                     \n                     The price.\n                     \n                     By 2023, it’s basically a cliché to say free-to-play games are the most expensive in the market. Everyone knows that. Snap is no different. You will download the game for free, sure, but you will pay — if not with money, than with the bad feeling of playing a lesser game than everyone else, and having to grind more to be less competitive. You’ll always be behind on the new cards, and every game you lose will remind you this problema can be solved with your credit card.\n                     \n                     Just get it, you’ll think. It’s just the price of an indie game per month to keep on top of the Season Passes, you’ll think. It won’t bankrupt me, you’ll think. I don’t even have time to play a new indie game every month to completion. This game brings me fun consistently. I like Marvel heroes! Pretend it’s a subscription! You’ll think all of these things and others to justify continuously spending time on intangible items that would have been unlockable through gameplay if this was a good old regular paid game as god intended.\n                     \n                     And then one day you’ll write a review on Marvel Snap on Letterboxd and, as you write, you’ll realize what an idiot you’ve been to think this was okay. And you will decide, right then and there, while writing the penultimate paragraph, to just uninstall Snap and get a new indie game instead.\n                     \n                     I think I’ll start with Pizza Tower. Yeah. :) I hear great things, and it’s even cheaper than a Snap season pass.\n                     \n                     Now that feels great.\n                     \n                     …\n                     \n                     I once heard that the act of writing is in itself the act of thinking, just a bit slower and more methodical. I can now state with confidence: that tracks.',N'2024-04-15'),
(611, 7,N'I played this game every day between October 1 and February 7. The gameplay of Snap is excellent, and for a while the treadmill is really enticing—I earned new cards at a pace and in an order that successfully sparked some inspiration in the new combos I could try. When that happened, I could play dozens of games whittling the new deck and strategy down, until I got something new that did the same thing, and so on. As deck variety increases so does strategic complexity, and the game is excellent at getting you time and opportunity to explore its systems; theres not many explicit tutorials, but the card effects are simple and the at your decks grows feels so natural. It must be said the card game itself feels really well-designed and balanced, and for many characters right on theme. I had a great time for a long time.',N'2024-01-12'),

(617, 6,N'I need to preface this with the fact that I have not played the DLC, but I dont think they would change my stance on the game tbh. This is a playable anime, for better or worse. While the story scenario, animation, artwork, and music are phenomenal, it leaves you desiring more of a game. There are a ton of cutscenes and QTEs, and the gameplay itself is fun but nothing of real depth. Dont get me wrong, I didnt hate it and enjoyed the ride despite this essential being an interactive movie with some shmup or beat em sections. The shmup sections I actually found to be tedious and not really all that fun to play. The gameplay in these sections feel like they are too easy and youre just locking on until something blows up, with little player agency. It lacks weight until the end where the difficulty is cranked in these sections. As previously mentioned, the combat is serviceable but nothing to really write home about. I think more combos and variety wouldve put this another tier up. I think the game gets maybe a little too bonkers and self-indulgent at points with Asura and his rage, but it kind of adds to the insanity of the story. Id recommend playing this once as it genuinely is a really fun ride.

(624, 6,N'Peace Walker is by all accounts a worthy canonical chapter in the saga, with its own dignity in terms of the themes covered and consideration for the in-depth development of the characters. On the gameplay experience aspects, it is also a pretty good transposition of the mechanics from previous games to a handheld console, especially considering the major limitations of the psp: clearly affected by this are mainly the ai of the enemies, the complexity of the environments and a certain overall fluidity of the experience, which can initially seem quite clunky. Good choices were therefore to model the gameplay in a relatively short mission structure, to increase action sequences over stealth phases and to be inspired by the type of games proposed by the highly successful titles on psp, such as Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. The result is a very fun game with various customization options and a very high level of replayability with an almost arcade-like flavor in improving your gaming execution, that may annoy those who rightly believe that such a title deserved more attention, but which in the end, considering the finished product, turns out to be decidedly remarkable.',N'2024-01-15'),

Players expecting a similar experience to previously mentioned games would be in for a big surprise, as this title lacked all the tropes you would expect in a typical RPG; no levels, no parties, no item shops, no grinding. Vagrant Story\s main appeal, at the time and currently, is its diversion from the norm of what RPGs were expected to be.

A shame, too, because this Deus Ex Universe initiative could\ve been some of the best shit in videogames if it weren\t for the Warner Bros. retardation that somehow found it\s way in Square Enix, trying to establish some sort of big franchise off the back of one successful game and a promising sequel you decide to not have enough faith in at the last minute, which only goes to ruin any prospects your franchise might have had in the first place. I hope that Eidos Montreal is now at least in a real position to make a real continuation of this game, because, though the social commentary isn\t the best, the aesthetics and the immersive-simmness of the Deus Ex reboot games cannot be left by the wayside.

With it being a prequel of sorts to Nioh 1 it can be played in isolation and I honestly recommend it it’s much tougher than Nioh 1 but because of this it makes it easier to jump into a Nioh 1 playthrough since it’s the same game but with less mechanics overall such as burst counters and Yokai attacks.

Only a couple of midgame maps are really boring, but the entire cast stands out and this is the first time in the series (I suppose FE2, in a janky way, had branched promotions) that youre really given the chance to customize your units. The entire cast is great: colorful characters that dont feel too tropey, and I can forgive the GBA/early console support system for being what it is given its from that era of Fire Emblem.

(657, 6,N'replayed this one to do the ephraim route. i think coming out of a replay of the first classic fe game i ever played multiple years after starting this series has made me appreciate it a lot more. it still has one of the best casts, probably the best visuals and soundtrack the series had on the gba, the story is one of my favorites in fire emblem when viewed from both routes, and lyon is easily the best main antagonist in the series. i do think the maps are pretty easy on normal mode, but the maps are well designed and its far from the easiest. i honestly wonder why the difficulty is such a point of contention for fe8 but not awakening which is much easier.',N'2025-06-17'),

Obviously this is an extreme passion vanity project the likes of which rarely gets mass distribution in video games even in the indie scene, let alone a boxed product by a reputable developer. This is more like something that would get dropped by Pendulum Pictures on a box of 50 shot on video flicks than anything else. And guess what?

I cant tell you a thing that happened in this game but I can tell you that Herzogs stories have more male nudity in them than a Joaquin Phoenix movie and I did a stunningly difficult karaoke minigame to 99 Luftballoons while my character and Stephanie Joosten looked like they were singing at gunpoint.\n                     \n                     The weirdness carries over into the traditional levels too, with dialogue peppered in and just an incredible awkwardness to every combat encounter. Guns are formally useless (one of the things I think is surprisingly worse about this game next to Devils Third, a modern gaming classic) and swordplay is very simplistic, but theres fun to be had in the RSI inducing button mashing, mostly because its really difficult so you have to actually learn parries and shit. There are encounters that are like pulling fucking teeth though, the boss fight against August is one of the absolute worst I can remember, the game is just not fair or deep or varied lol.

Like, the bizarre dialogue coupled with iffy voice acting with an extra dose of horrible sound mixing should be a recipe for a bad time. But I found it very endearing. The actual story is not good, though. It starts off interesting, but has absolutely zero pay-off in any way, shape, or form. I don’t know if this is a time or budget constraint or it’s just bad on its own. Either way, it doesnt really matter to me.\n                     \n                     The gameplay is a mix of linear combat levels, with some minigames and exploration of the police station in between them. The minigames are fun on the first go, but I never went back for seconds. And exploring the station was fun the first time, but after that you just kinda mindlessly run around it looking for new intel pick-ups after every level. It’s nothing special, but offers a nice repose from the combat. The combat is pretty simple, but effective. You have a sword, and some guns. I mostly played aggressively, not using guns for the most part. Just slashing around, and finding it very fun. Attacking, and parrying. This being a game made by former Ninja Gaiden devs, I’m sure there’s plenty of secret techniques that deepen the combat. But I’m a scrub, and don’t know anything about that. I did discover block canceling tho, and felt like a genius. The actual game is pretty hard. Those ninjas, man… A nice challenge is a good thing, but the checkpoint placement really grinded my gears. Dying could mean having to repeat like 5 minutes of constant combat which gets pretty annoying. But other than that, I honestly had a fun time.',N'2024-12-29'),

But great animations doesnt excuse the downright inferior ghost designs (the fucking thing looks like minion knock offs) and the constant back n forth made it a slog to get through. You may say that the first game is similar with the backtracking. Though I feel the first title is all about exploring this one environment making you attached to it.

Ultimately I had fun.',N'2024-10-14'),
(671, 6,N'I think the most interesting thing about Valkyrie Elysium is that it’s not a story about saving the world. It’s about what happens in that period where everything is ending already. Most of my time playing this game was spent in ruins, fighting the vengeful spirits that still roam the land alongside those spirits who chose to fight with me and listening to the voices that had long perished. And although Odin tells you from the beginning that your efforts are done so save it, actually walking through Valkyrie Elysiums world, the question haunted me: What is there left so save? This question is at the heart of the game. Spoilers follow The Valkyrie, a hollow shell at the beginning, distanced from the world she wants to save, becomes more and more involved over the course of the story – through the help of the spirits that chose to stay with her. And in the end, the player must choose what to do with that involvement. The different endings all give a different answer to the questions “What is there left to save? What is there left to fight for?”. The so-called “true ending” has a somewhat cynical answer to this: That the gods who were responsible for the worlds’ demise will not see the next one. Another ending plainly states: heterosexual love. In every ending the world we walked through in the game ends. The agency of the player is to decide what happens next.',N'2024-08-07'),

(674, 5,N'Since I just played the first one too most of my opinions are basically comparisons, but I do think both games are very good with different highs and lows between the two. This one has an actual story this time, unlike the last one which was a collection of somewhat thrown together get to and beat the guy levels threaded together loosely (especially in the DS version). This time there\s a thread that runs from the start to the end and is helped by the new-to-the-series voiced characters and script which thankfully doesn\t quite fall into the overly quirky style that later games would become defined by. The levels, while occasionally a little too long, are still very engaging though i\m not sure which games levels really kept my attention better. Despite being DC Super Heroes it\s still hugely Batman skewed, you\d have to wait for another sequel to really reach into more DC character territory, but this one had a nice roster of fun characters. I didn\t have much interest in 100%ing this time round but i\ve definitely come close before from what I remember, just that it takes a while and i\m not sure I want to play the same levels twice in a row immediately.

The music as well needs to be mentioned, as it is amazing and fits every levels unique artstyle perfectly. It is a bit on the shorter side but Id rather have a game that leaves me wanting more rather than thinking it was too much. I think my biggest complaint is that it is a little too easy. I dont normally play platformers and I found it not that challenging, where I usually messed up jumps because of timing rather than precision and movement. I dont mind games being easy, but I think I wouldve liked a little more challenge, especially with the enemies. Theyre all quite simple and are more objects rather than creatures you counter despite their cute designs.

Theres a dab move though, so this game is turbo based on that basis alone. The writing and the voice acting delivery of said writing was kinda cringe to me personally but idk other people might like it.

A compilation that is somehow less than the sum of its parts is a very strange thing indeed. You get the Taxman remastered ports of sonic 1, 2, and CD here with the drop dash included, plus a brand new port of sonic 3 & knuckles also with drop dash support and in widescreen for the first time. The games all play perfectly fine but theres just a bunch of tiny little annoyances that add up over time, such as tails AI not really working all that right and you constantly hear him jumping and smashing into things offscreen which can be annoying, theres some occasional bugs and whatnot, and they absolutely BUTCHERED the audio in sonic 3, using lower-quality audio recordings of the game audio plus worse re-recordings of replacement tunes for the licensed tracks.

Pikmin 1 had a bunch of wide maps to explore, find where everything is, and then formulate an attack plan on how to get it all as efficiently as possible. With the dungeon system of this game, levels feel more like hubs to enter dungeons, where there you solve various linear puzzles and combat challenges. The vibes are different.

I fail to remember much of anything about my experience with it and, when I look at the last 15 years of games since it came out, I feel like it\s the game of that Indie Game: The Movie trifecta  that left the smallest footprint, if any. Super Meat Boy drove the 2d platformer renaissance for Western developers and Fez presented a world of puzzles so enigmatic and dense, yet drenched in an alluring aesthetic that you couldn\t help but dive deeper into the pool. Meanwhile, Braid had uhhh mediocre at best platforming, puzzles that have left no lasting impression on me, an aesthetic comparable to a sack of potatoes, and hamfisted attempts at artistic concepts such as What if Mario, but in Real Life? and You can reverse time in the game, but you can\t in real life. Anyways, humans created the atom bomb. I truly hated my time with it and I don\t think I\ll ever understand the praise it receives, but hey isn\t that quite apt when the creator of the art I\m critiquing says that critics shouldn\t criticize the art that they don\t truly understand the point of? Who decides the point of a piece of art anyways? I guess the artist truly knows what their intention was when they made it, but is intention always the same as the point? The intention behind dropping two nukes on an enemy nation might be to deal heavy damage and weaken the opposing forces, but the point is to establish an overwhelming aura of dominance that ripples through generations. Did you like me comparing this dude\s attempts at artistry to the nuclear bombings of Japan in WWII? No? Was it too much? Yeah I guess that\s fair.

(710, 0,N'One of my favorite games of all time.\n                     \n                     Banjo Tooie is a 3D platformer collect-a-thon. A lot of its charm comes from the humorous dialogue between characters. It’s packed with quite a bit of dark humor and situational comicalities throughout each of the 9 worlds.\n                     \n                     The worlds are vast and eclectic, meaning you’re left with very little to be desired and a lot to explore.\n                     \n                     Being a sequel to Banjo Kazooie, Tooie has a lot to live up to and it did not disappoint. I didn’t really want to compare the two, but oh well, everyone else is 🤷🏻\u200d♂️.\n                     \n                     One key difference is that in Kazooie, each session in a world is somewhat discontinuous. What this means is you can collect 99 music notes in a world, leave and come back, and you’ll have to start back at 0. Whereas in Tooie, everything you collect is permanent and you don’t need to worry about losing progress.\n                     \n                     Tooie is a lot more legato when it comes to how the worlds are interconnected and honestly that was something I really loved when playing it.\n                     \n                     Oh, the camera is much better in Tooie too.\n                     \n                     A common complaint I see is that there’s an overwhelming amount of content and people that played Tooie after Kazooie thought that took away from the experience. I actually played Tooie first and felt that Kazooie was lacking.\n                     \n                     One significant aspect of games that greatly affects the flow of a game is the feeling of progression. This is something I think Banjo Tooie does extremely well. There are consistently new unlockables whether it’s new combat moves, mobility utilities, worlds, secret paths, etc, there’s always something new. However, because there’s so much, there is a LOT of backtracking, especially if you want to collect everything. For me this was a good thing, but I know it’s not for everyone.\n                     \n                     There are many places in each world where you can get stuck due to not having unlocked something elsewhere or just not being able to figure out a puzzle. As a child, this was a fun challenge. I cannot tell what it would be like playing for the first time as an adult.\n                     \n                     I’d be lying if I said nostalgia didn’t have something to do with how I feel about this game. But I assure you, both playing (and 100%ing) as a kid as well as in my 20’s I gave this a solid 10/10.\n                     \n                     There’s also a multiplayer mode which are all the mini games banjo and kazooie come across in the campaign. I had 3 siblings so we had a ton of fun playing these, but I imagine not many of us play couch multiplayer anymore so this is more of a side note bonus thing.',N'2024-12-02'),

(722, 0,N'The original Jet Set Radio was a fickle game, luring players in with its phenomenal vibes only to trap them in a game with floaty controls and a jank camera. This game does not have that problem. Compared to the first game, the controls are a lot tighter and the camera doesnt nearly have as many issues. That being said, this isnt a whole improvement over the first game, as the level structure for this game is more wide and open ended, leading to level design that isnt as polished IMO. Lots of tall vertical shafts you have to precariously climb up where one wrong move sends you all the way back down, and stuff like that gets kinda tedious after a while. Aesthetically it is on par with the original game, though I will say the licensed half of the soundtrack is weaker here than it was in game 1. This is definitely the most modern feeling JSR so its an actual crime that this game has never been rereleased in the over 20 years since it has came out as of me writing this review.

Despite birthing some elements that would be integral to Fire Emblem as a franchise going forward, it’s also the most unique entry in the series by far. Even with all of its influence and acclaim, not ONE game past this has ever tried replicating everything this game did. Some of that could be attributed to the new systems being seen more as flaws rather than benefits, or the sheer complexity maybe too scary for newer players. I’m not sure.\n                     \n                     I finished this game over a week ago, and I’ve been banging my head on the wall trying to figure out what to say.

I’d love to write a review as long as a single enemy phase in this game but I really can’t do that as much as I try.

There are so many moments where you just.. can’t save everyone. The other games have similar moments, but this one melds it into the gameplay so perfectly and precisely. Every map is vast with history, communities, and density. They genuinely do feel like actual locales rather than “a video game level”. That goes both to its benefit and detriment from a gameplay perspective, but from a\n                     \n                      story\n                     \n                     perspective, it’s pure bliss. We follow our heroes through lush forests, sprawling plains, harsh mountains, scorching deserts etc. You slowly proceed through this seemingly endless war, each map becoming more and more hopeless.\n                     \n                     I should also preface that you need to experience this story blind. I know it’s very hard to do as such with how much the middle plot twist is spoiled to everyone, but I encourage you to stay as blind as possible.\n                     \n                      Genealogy’s\n                     \n                     narrative is fantastic, not only for a Fire Emblem game but for a piece of media in general. Seliph is one of my favorite video game characters of all time because of how we follow his journey from suffering a harsh young life, but growing to become a fine young man himself capable of what his mission is. Once again, I’m not going to elaborate so the reader can find out what happens themselves, but the story is, no exaggeration, simply masterful.\n                     \n                     Generational storytelling is one of my favorite tropes of all time. Seeing how descendants of a generation will remedy the mistakes, regrets, or failures of their predecessors has always been so engaging to me. While\n                     \n                      Genealogys\n                     \n                     latter half isnt nearly as narratively complex as the former half, its story about the next generation of heroes is among one of my favorites for this trope. Ily Seliph.\n                     \n                     Presentation also goes a long way, of course. Every music track in the game adds to the atmosphere so heavily, it’s easily one of the best soundtracks I’ve heard on the Super Famicom. Some tracks were so masterfully composed I nearly shed tears, I couldn’t believe how well it played me especially when I can rarely cry at soundtracks anymore. The graphics can be hit or miss, especially with the character portraits, but the maps and environments are top notch. I could really look at them for so long.\n                     \n                     I think that’s pretty much all I could think of to say about\n                     \n                      Genealogy of the Holy War\n                     \n                     . As a game… it’s a mess. Possibly even objectively bad. But as a story, a piece of artistry… it’s an undeniable masterpiece. It’s certainly not for everyone, I’m aware, but it is worth experiencing in full at LEAST once. Not my favorite Fire Emblem because of the gameplay, but definitely the best narrative and cast of characters in my eyes.\n                     \n                     Also ever notice how so many of the people who say this game sucks (or other classic FE games for that matter) are Three Houses fans or have Three Houses pfps? curious ….',N'2024-06-20'),
(726, 6,N'A great game, and my favorite of the Fire Emblem Franchise. The game is kind of easy for a Fire Emblem game, and its clearly not the best tactical experience youll get in this franchie. This game is more a playable story than it is a game with a good story in it. Every element of Genealogy serves the narrative, the strenght of the characters reflects their developpement and their place in the world, the challenges are constantly evolving to flow with the story, story events that you cant even participate in take place during fights... This allow the universe to feel real, and we can feel the stakes of whats happening. Its clearly not a game for everyone, it can be slow and tedious at times, and the story can be less interesting in the second half, but if you think a game using his mecanics mainly to tell a compelling plot with memorable characters may be for you, Ill blindy recommand that you at least give it a try. Dont be afraid of the difficulty if youre not used to play old Fire Emblem games, you can save litteraly every turn, and you have broken characters among your units.',N'2025-03-10'),

Shinobu and Maya are fun to play as but dont reach their full potential until their full movesets are unlocked.

The level design works quite alright, giving ample reason to use either girl and the tools at their disposal at any given opportunity. But it doesnt compare to the Classicvanias, which require precise and deliberate maneuvers to make it through various do-or-die scenarios. The gameplay here just isnt busy or demanding enough.

Linearity is more pronounced now, with things like weapons no longer being found on the map, but bought from a merchant, along with weapon upgrades.

The soundtrack is a never-ending bop that pairs with each level brilliantly, and makes you want to just monkey dance to it rather than play the level. I would list the tracks that I love in this game, but I am afraid that would be damn near every song in the ost. The level design, mechanics, and themes of this game are elite and set a new bar for what can be done it platformers in general. Every idea was placed squarely on the table and it never dwells on one idea for long enough for it to get stale. When mechanics do return, you find yourself saying Lets go zip vines are back rather than losing interest because they are so fun and implemented so expertly. They decided to skip the pleasantries of making a boring world one boss and just make every boss in this game great, and it really is a blast to play the different characters.

Theres no other FE game that matches its raw gameplay integrity and absolutely genius ideas, with Genealogy at least coming in close second. For every bullshit thing the game throws at you, the game gives you quadruple the amount of bullshit to use against the enemy - like there are so many brave and master weapons and staves that basically get handed to you on a silver platter, and while there are a few chapters that are trial and error, actually figuring them out genuinely feels so good - no other Fire Emblem game gives me this much dopamine. Hell, I made a long ass text file documenting my experiences with the game, going in depth on every strategy I utilised in every chapter and giving pointers and advice that either myself or someone else could use whenever they decide to play.

Shouzou Kaga was evidently opposed to making a Fire Emblem game on the N64, believing the 3D graphics would hurt the appearance of his characters, and that philosophy to keep the characters 2D carried over to the PS1’s Tear Ring Saga: Yutona Heroes War Chronicles. That too went well, but let’s focus on FE5.',N'2025-08-23'),
(753, 8,N'This game probably took about 10 years from my lifespan but i still loved it, the infamous difficulty of the game is actually really satisfying and well balanced especially in the first half, but after chapter 18 or so is.... painful, to say the least. Still, after strategizing for hours, constantly saving and loading states and rage moments,sense of accomplishment i get from beating a stage from a 24 year old SRPG is remarkable\n                     \n                     Probably my favorite aspect about FE5 is the overall tone of it. While FE4 had it\s fair share of dark moments, this game is straight up depressing, you actually feel how bleak and despair the situation is in every chapter. By the beggining of the game, you feel completely lost,and confused by the mechanics and the difficulty, just like Leif, feeling lost on this brutal war. You are not a group of experienced and heroic knights, leading for victory, you are mostly common folk going against a full fledged empire, and you\re obviously going to get obliterated against such force. But as you learn the mechanics of the game and gain strong units, a hope slowly rises, and you go from how the hell am i going to survive from this? to Hey, i can actually do this! and you start to command larger armies on bigger maps. And then, you are facing with the strongest forces of the Empire. It\s actually even harder then before, but you have so much more experince with the game,you don\t feel as powerless as before. And after you\ve gone through so much, beating the game and seeing those credits rolled is one of the most rewarding feelings a game can give to you\n                     \n                     This, is phenomenal storytelling, and you can only have this in a videogame, that unforgiving difficulty is one of the finest examples of storytelling through gameplay. That\s why remake of this game is probably going to suck, since they\ll inevatiabely tone down the difficulty.\n                     \n                     Gameplay has a surprising amount of resource management, and i love this, you can capture enemies to steal their equipment,but it\s significantly harder and risky to do,since you\ll deal much less and take much more damage. But since you don\t get much chance to buy and repair weapons, you really have to pay attention the resources you have, and use them in the most efficient way to overcome challenges you face\n                     \n                     Fatigue is also a new mechanic, which if you use a unit too much, you won\t be able to use them in the next chapter, which makes powerful units more tricky to use, adding another depth to the gameplay. You\ll only want to use them when necessary, so you actually have a reason to use less powerful units, i gotta say this was hard to get used to, especially after i obliterated every enemy with Ayra and Larcei in FE4, but it didn\t took long to for me to actually like it\n                     \n                     Also fantastic map designs suplements the complex gameplay mechanics brilliantly. FE5 abandons the massive maps of FE4 in favor of smaller, but focused maps with multiple objectives, and while some enemy placements made me want to torn apart my bone structure from my skin(those goddamn ballistas will give me nightmares) for the most part i really apprecieted the variety in both the map design and objectives. You have defense, escape, fog of war(which isn\t THAT bad in my opinion) and of course normal seize missions. Also each map has it\s own unique objective, which makes every single map even more memorable. Varied objectives makes each chapter fresh, which is something i\ve never seen in an SRPG\n                     \n                     Weakest part of this game imo are the characters, in FE4, you have a lot of optional conversations between characters, and those conversations actually give a decent personality and development to each unit, in FE5, most of the cast has 5 lines of dialogues at most, and all of them are in the chapter you recruit them.\n                     \n                     But i really like how the game tells what happened to them after the credits rolled\n                     \n                     Though this doesn\t mean that this game has no good character writing, far from it, Leif is one the best written main character\s i\ve ever seen in a game. Like i mentioned before, you start of the game as powerless, and with zero knowledge on the complex mechanics of the game. Just like Leif, who\s a 15 year old who has never commanded an army. This is obviously no coincidence, Leif represents the player, but unlike most games that have a main character which isrepresenting the playerLeif isn\t a silent protagonist, his development from an inexperienced kid to a mature war commander is very natural, and paralells brilliantly with the development of you as a player, as you understand how the game works and start using the tools you have in the most optimal ways. Leif alone is enough to say this game has fantastic character writing\n                     \n                     I\m not sure if Fire Emblem 5 is better than 4,but still, this is one the finest SRPG\s ever made. It\s frusturating for sure, but it\s so well designed in nearly every aspect, it\s impossible for me to hate it. I\d highly recommend it if you liked FE4, and simply want to see more from this world.',N'2025-05-21'),

The NoAH additions, such as the character routes, really help the game feel like the fully realised experience it was meant to be originally. I cant say I thought they were all bangers, but the depth they add, along with what they add to the gameplay experience overall, helps give a sense of thematic finality, if that makes sense.

(761, 9,N'Played the PS4 version of this because it was free and had an obtainable platinum, but also because I love the Fallout series! Its not your standard RPG fare, rather a base-building simulator, similar to the ant farm like layout from games like XCOM. I enjoyed the majority of my playthrough as it was something different for me to play and compared to the fallout Im used to. There are microtransactions, which I hate that they even exist in gaming, but its definitely a lot less greedy here as they dont shove it in your face every five minutes. I played 67 hours of this, got my platinum and I never spend a single cent on Microtransactions or felt I had to, as the game gives you lootboxes at a good rate from just natural gameplay. In the end, the game did ware on me a bit towards the end, and I probably would never play it again unless they added new DLC. But is free on PS4, so there is no real reason to at least give it a try!',N'2024-04-13'),

(762, 7,N'This game is very easy not to like.  It has one of the craziest motion control mechanics grazed on a platformer and Sonics movement at the beginning course of the game is not great.

Theres a lot of emphasis on motion controls with the wii remote and they want you to be precise with em when the controls themselves are as imprecise as possible. Kinda like super monkey ball banana blitz except at least that game felt like the levels were designed around the new control scheme to a degree. Instead of doing regular levels in a linear order like literally every sonic game before it, this game has you do a bunch of scattered mini-objectives in order to progress, except even then its not entirely obvious which ones you need to do to actually proceed.

Crows death at the end of the (second to) last dungeon was the only moment that made me feel anything. Then rather than end on what seemed like shouldve been the ending, you start playing as thr protagonist from the previous arc and get to beat up this games protagonist, which was admittedly cathartic in a way. Then the game temporarily goes back to the structure of cold steel 1 to show the characters back in their school life before throwing in a 25 floor, randomly generated dungeon at the last minute.

The end-game challenges, reminiscent of Wiley\s fortress and boss rushes after Megaman has fully self-actualized, were the highlight. Boss rushes in particular were fun to dissect and master.

In SMTIV at least, these were entirely optional and you had to purchase them. In Persona 5 Royal, they included the DLC, which again, I could ignore if they are optional, but I cant. Unlike in pervious games, there are legitimate fusions using legitimate personas that allow you to straight-up just get these P2W personas naturally, which I absolute fathom and throws the balance of the game out the window.\n                     \n                     -And more importantly, the entirety of Kasumis character pre-third semester (I want to punch her)',N'2025-06-22'),

However, I cannot say that Persona 5 is a bad game, although my experience with it was a bit rough.

(803, 2,N'hmmmmmmm. Kind of a divisive one here for me personally. While I liked the characters, the plot felt kind of lacking and the connections to the other games in the series that were so hyped up by nintendo in marketing really didnt add to much, if anything. You could have replaced the references to the previous games with original stuff and nothing substantial would be different. In that aspect, this game was really disappointing. The villains were also an absolute joke, with the Mobius guys being the most generically boring guys in history and N being immensely less cool the more you learn about him. In terms of the gameplay though, it was certainly fun. The class system makes combat very customizable and I feel its absolutely possible to sink your teeth really into managing your party to get the most out of all your options. I also did a lot of side content in this game, which is uncharacteristic of me as I beelined it through the first two games. Exploration of the worlds is always fun in xenoblade games, and this is no exception. Perhaps I am just getting tired of the series, but this definitely didnt hit as much as the first or even the second game to me. Still would suggest to anyone that enjoyed the first two games because the gameplay is still fun but like yeaaaahh...',N'2025-07-24'),

My first attempt ended pretty swiftly since I didnt have a controller and the keyboard controls are... really bad! The game didnt quite jive with me at that point, but my main problem at that point was the hell that is cuphead with keyboard controls. A year or two later, I would play through the whole game, and later the DLC, in co-op with a friend. We did this over Steam so there was a bit of lag, but I had a controller and a friend to help me through. I enjoyed the game a lot more, to the point where I was the one pushing us to do the DLC together, but it still didnt quite enamour me like Id wanted it to. My main complaint at the time was the design of some of the bosses. I felt that a lot of them relied on being able to pay attention to cues and bullets coming from multiple parts of the screen, often with them all acting completely independently. I have a huge amount of trouble processing all of that information, so oftentimes I found bosses just far too overwhelming. Not a design issue or anything, more of a personal one.',N'2024-03-29'),

(812, 1,N'Loved this a lot. I missed the sense of exploration from Dark Souls, but the core action mechanics and satisfying parries more than made up for it. Other than a basic whole number for your damage and health, there\s no worrying about RPG values here. It\s a true action game taking place within the open-world Metroid-ish Souls structure, backed up with\n                     \n                      some\n                     \n                     items and buffs and junk if you decide to use them. But the lack of gear is probably the best thing about this - no armour sets, no elemental stats, no sword that deals +5 damage but -2 stamina. Funnily enough, people say this is the hardest FromSoftware game, but after a while it felt much, much easier to me than Dark Souls\n                     \n                      because\n                     \n                     there was nothing in my way except my own skill, which I greatly prefer. No main bosses that required some stupid consumable item for me to defeat properly. I don\t like feeling as if I need to grind to make myself better, because then it\s this vague guessing game of numbers. There were a few points in Dark Souls where I felt robbed of a boss fight because I must have been over-levelled, or I said screw it, summoned an NPC once and then steam-rolled the boss. No hollow victories here in Sekiro - although admittedly, once you get that perfect parry timing down, sometimes victory comes so fast that it\n                     \n                      almost\n                     \n                     feels unsatisfying.

Still has a lot of baffling decisions sprinkled throughout, though, which isn\t new for a Fromsoft game but this game is far more rigid in terms of there being a correct way to approach encounters so it only magnifies these issues when they appear. Soulsborne games (and ESPECIALLY Elden Ring) usually have a billion different ways you can break the game over your knee if something is really giving you trouble, but most of the time in Sekiro if the game throws something at you that\s bad and sucks you have to actually engage with the thing that\s bad and sucks, and that\s bad and sucks.',N'2024-07-07'),

Then came this game in 2019. Holy fuck. Not only was this the first RE game I played on launch, but it just blew me away with how polished it was. The police station feels more real than ever, with dark and immersive areas that make you feel trapped and scared. The graphics also contribute to this, being incredibly realistic yet stylized, even if spme faces look a bit weird. I complained about how in the original RE playing as both characters wasnt worth it because the story barely changed, but thats completely fixed here. Not only do each of them have compelling and really different stories, but they also have different accessible rooms, gameplay segments and even final bosses. Another recurring problem with this franchise is that the best area is always the first one, and although thats also the case here, both the sewers and the lab are really fun and memorable in their own way.

The story itself is ok, but the final act is clearly unfinished and rushed has probably one of the worst final bosses in the whole series which really undermines the ending a bit.

I did find it to be very difficult at points and it can be somewhat easy to get lost. Also a vital system for progression can be too cryptic, but rewarding once you crack it. That’s about my only gripes. Must play game. Gorgeous artstyle, no handholdy nonsense, fun gameplay, top tier OST, great story, and an overall perfect action-adventure game.

(839, 6,N'Tunic is a wonderful 2D Zelda-like that feels like a love letter to the genre. Between an extremely charming aesthetic, fun and interesting items, and being extremely packed with puzzles and mystery, it would be hard not to recommend this game to any fan of the genre. The inclusions of things like a made up language and the instruction booklet all work to great effect to simulate that feeling you had when you were a kid trying to play a game like Links Awakening. Discovery is always well rewarded and always feel earned by the player. I feel as though there are very few handouts in terms of progression through the game, so even just simply navigating the world feels meaningful and accomplishing.

The soundtrack is really good and I enjoyed the characters quite a bit, even if they could feel quite dimensional. You dont really get that many RPG elements so you cant really focus or build on specific aspects, but it reminds me of a more streamlined monster hunter when combating robots using only slings and arrows. I think the game definitely was missing a lot of aspects that are commonplace in the genre, but this was their first open-world game. There were frustrating moments, and a lot of the times enemies move too quickly even during slow-mo to let you take advantage of shooting weak points, and I think the melee combat is pretty terrible. A light and a heavy sweep, that is pretty much it. The platforming is really good but also got annoying to traverse sometimes, epseically with how many mountain areas there are.

The era of Ninja Turtles that most intrest me like im sure many, is the 80s cartoon era. This game is a really cool time capsule of not only by playing into the iconic gameplay style of the time ( the Konami Ninja Turtle arcade games), but it perseveres most of the original voice actors, art style, referances and characters. The game almost can feel like a crash course to somebody like me who doesnt know much about the series, which I really apreciate. There are some really good tracks in this, most of which were composed by the Sonic Mania composer. The physical edition even came with a Pizza Hut coupon for a free personal pan pizza, which is incredible (I ate pizza pretty much every time I played this game).

Generally speaking, I enjoy playing stealth games with a controller. Stealth, like racing games, is a genre that benefits greatly from analog sticks. At the heart of a great stealth game is nail-biting tension and suspense. Vulnerability is stressed through risk outweighing reward. On a keyboard, all of your inputs are static. Are you pressing up? Good, you\re moving up. Jolting an analog stick up can mean the difference between shuffling silently and bringing in nearby ears for inspection. Even in games where this choice tends to be an illusion, it heightens the already high stakes of weaving in and out of crowded spaces as little more than a specter in the night.

This feels like the predecessor to Chrono Trigger in many ways, so fans of that game will immediately see similarities. It’s mostly a very accessible game, but my one big fault is that the game lets you choose any of these chapters to start with. Certain chapters I enjoyed within the context of the rest of the game, but are particularly unconventional and could make for a very weak first impression. Aside from that tho, I honestly loved this. Combat is a big standout for me, each encounter was like a mini tactics battle with a really fun grid system. I had to thoughtfully consider how to dispatch enemies effectively, and while it’s far from a difficult game, each battle had me engaged. Presentation is gorgeous with the HD-2D Switch remake, it’s a total overhaul that still remains faithful to the original.

And while I won’t spoil the final segments that come after you finish the seven main chapters, I found them to be so fun and satisfying that they elevate the entire experience. This definitely deserves to be considered a classic of the era right alongside FFVI and Chrono Trigger.',N'2025-06-09'),
(889, 4,N'Such a creative and imaginative RPG from start to finish that Id honestly place it among my favorites. The amount of love pumped into this remake is brimming and hard to not smile at.

(889, 8,N'Honestly, there just wasnt enough here to keep me engaged. Most of the chapters dont encourage exploration, the combat is lackluster with little to no skill involved, and the characters are underwhelming on the whole with very little emotional impact. The space episode was the best one that I got to, and even that had me rolling my eyes at some points. I expect more from RPGs, even remasters of old classics. If the combat is boring, the story had better be engaging. If the story is underwhelming, I want to be excited for each battle. Neither of these is the case for this game.

(895, 7,N'I really enjoyed this one. The story is super interesting, most characters are multi-layered and more complex than they initially seem, and how this game handles skills and thoughts is genius. As most reviews for this game have said, its really great that failing a skill check does not necessarily mean youre now going through a worse version of the game (in some cases its even a more fun route). The politics and wordbuilding are also super deep and will really please those who enjoy those topics in their media.  I personally found myself more engrossed by the games study of the main character, who was as awful and destructive as he was likeable and relatable. I also found it incredible how the writers have managed to give him his own personality while also allowing a huge amount of his character to be determined by the player. Normally games tend to present one of these two archetypes for their main character, but this mixture of both helps a lot in giving the player a much deeper connection with the character while also allowing the character to serve the main themes of the story.\n                     \n                     On that note, the amount of choices they give you for customizing him are insane, and they really dont feel overwhelming despite there being multiple methods to change your character.

The fighting system works and seems interesting at the beginning but by the end, it is barely enjoyable, spamming skills and rolling around from hundreds of enemies to... what? To get a new pair of the same-looking rounded glasses (no no no we still do not get that this is a Harry-Potter-inspired game)? 33 copies of the same old black cloak? Same thing with exploring -- theres simply no reason to explore the giant territory of non-interesting copy-paste bandit and goblin camps, a stupid forest that spread across the Highlands that looks exactly the same at any point of your destination (apart from the small part to the south) to get a bunch of decorative pieces.

The factory and jungle levels are cool, minecart levels can be a bit too strict. The boss fights are generally uninspired and the low part of the game, but the final boss is great.

O jogo mais divertido da saga até então, e acho difícil que enquanto jogo de pirata ele irá ser superado tão cedo. Felizmente todo o potencial desperdiçado do assassins creed III é aproveitado aqui. As caçadas são recompensadoras, assim como toda a exploração. Certo, talvez explorar um local para pegar baús que rendem pouco dinheiro não seja lá muito recompensador, mas ainda é divertido explorar esse mapa gigante, principalmente porque a escalada é muito valorizada e a quantidade de coletáveis é satisfatória, não exagerada e não pequena demais. As batalhas navais são fantásticas, e o combate com o personagem, mesmo sendo bem fácil, é dinâmico e divertido, mas o foco mesmo desse combate fica para o stealth, pois agora temos dardos de sono, dardos ensandecidos, pistolas, uma faca de arremesso que você pode pegar e tem que usar com cuidado por só poder levar uma, bombas de fumaça, uma gama enorme de abordagens que se pode ter com um refinamento bem melhor que os dos outros jogos, pois tudo aqui funciona muito bem.\n                     \n                     Dinheiro finalmente faz diferença no jogo, pois você precisa melhorae seu navio, e isso dá uma sensação de recompensa nos combates navais.

(922, 1,N'Truly a landmark in gaming. For every complaint I have, there are two or three things I love. I played Primehack and had an enhanced FOV since the original was so narrow, so I cant comment on any original hiccups in that department. The map and world design is incredibly atmospheric, with every new area feeling like a visual treat, Phendrana Drifts in particular. Prime is a commendable transition into the 3D space for the franchise, and it being the first attempt makes all missteps easy to forgive. Backtracking is a little rough (maybe just me but I never felt like I totally got the hang of which elevator went where without double checking), the mid-game feels unfinished (you fight 3 bosses, play for 5 hours, and then fight 3 more at the tail end), and some weapons feel underutilized (I barely touched the super variants until the Metroid Prime fight) but its a blast and really retains the feel of a 2D Metroid game at its core, with platforming as a main focus.',N'2025-01-10'),
(922, 4,N'Neat game. Controls were a bit interesting to get used to, but the game is built around them so there wasnt really much of a problem. I do wish the FOV was a bit bigger and you could see where you are landing when you have to do platforming, though. This game does a good job in putting the metroid formula in 3D, but because it is now in 3D, theres a lot more nooks and crannies that things are hidden in, so you have to definitely have your eyes more peeled than the 2D metroids. The map system is also more difficult to understand than the 2D metroids. I didnt even really have a problem with the mandatory mcguffin hunt at the end or the constant backtracking, since those are kind of staples of the Metroid series and serve to give you more opportunities to find secrets by constantly returning to places you have been before. Putting a fast travel option would completely defeat the purpose imo. At the end of the day, this game didnt blow me away like it did for so many other people, but I can still see a decent game when I play one, and this is definitely that.',N'2025-03-20'),

It created a new alien world that they could explore, it let you play how you wanted which wasnt popular at the time, and it really just created a lot of baselines for what the series would take advantage of later on. The soundtrack is legendary, the characters are so great, and the combat is... Okay. My biggest issue was the mako. Oh my god I hate the mako sections. Theyre boring, awkward, stupid, and I hate them. It made me stop doing side missions partway through because I just didnt want to drive through the mako anymore. But using squadmates and having them feel like team members was my favorite part, and I loved doing different missions with different companions.

Give me a Mario game that looks like this, give me a Pokemon game that looks like this, give me a fuckin GTA game that looks like this!! Genuinely what I would love more than anything else in the world is for the Zelda series - after Tears Of The Kingdom to come back to this style for the next mainline game. Dont just keep this relegated to remakes if you do Oracle Of Seasons & Ages, give me a full-on, original, top-down open-world game with this visual style.

(972, 2,N'In this first game, the story and switching between present day (circa 2007) and the past set in the Crusade era Holy Land is such an intriguing premise and the authenticity of the world and character design can be admired. That isn’t to say the game is the worst thing ever, but it truly is soooooooo tedious and repetitive that it’s tough to recommend. The parkour system is very cool and has a lot of attention to detail put into the running and climbing animations. Scaling towers and doing Leaps of Faiths is so fun which somewhat makes up for the overabundance of sync points. There are many other menial side missions that, while not lacking in variety, are just copy and pasted everywhere and it gets tiring very quickly. Play it if you’re curious as some of the stealth is fun (and a little more low key compared to later entires in the series), but don’t be surprised if it gets dull very quickly.',N'2024-05-20'),

É só ver que Prince of Persia fez mecânicas muito mais agradáveis, e que este deveria ser uma evolução pelo menos das escaladas, mas não é o que acontece. Basicamente o jogo não tem stealth, e isso matou a graça de muitas missões, pois você basicamente chega no inimigo e esfaqueia, depois aperta o botão para disfarçar. Me vi muitas vezes frustrado por ter de fazer missões repetitivas de assassinato onde tinham 3 alvos e se eu falhasse, ficava mais difícil porque os corpos dos que eu matei ainda estavam lá e os guardas ficavam em alerta, dificultando conseguir assassinar o alvo sem falhar, e as vezes os npcs (os loucos), simplesmente me empurravam, eu esbarrava em um guardsne falhava a missão.

I then played it again more recently, a couple of years ago to re-experience it and I love it. Ezio is the golden child of the series but Altair truly embodies the assassin in my mind infinitely better. Cold, calculating while still maintaining his humanity and code. I loved the city, running around and exploring while fighting enemies, but you definitely felt like there couldve been more tools to use in the game. I also really liked the Desmond sections, they had juuuussst enough mystery to them without being overwhelming.

This games story puts Brad through so much torment that it almost feels like it hates the player themself at times. I dont want to go into the story beats at all because theyre best experienced completely blindly, but just know that despite how damn funny the humor in this game is, its revenge narrative and main character are heartwrenching at times. Its difficult to progress in this game at times because of how fucked the next steps that Brad is going to take are. If youre familiar with how dark Mother 3 can get, this game has that same sort of feeling, but can obviously go so much further with it because its not a Nintendo game.\n                     \n                     I wish I could sing nothing BUT praises for this game, but it is an RPGMaker game. I love turn-based combat games, but LISA doesnt do too much to make its combat exciting. The encounters arent annoying, just couldve been less repetitive after you figure out what status effects do and how to execute dial combos. Also, the customization in this game doesnt really do it for me, its just completely whatever.\n                     \n                     Navigating the world can be a puzzle sometimes and its pretty fun, not revolutionary, but its hard to be bored on your way to your next destination.\n                     \n                     Overall though, great experience that I have to recommend to anyone that enjoys RPGs in the style of the Mother series or Undertale, as much as Im sure that comparison is such a beaten dead horse that its just a pile of guts by now.',N'2024-12-12'),

(984, 9,N'just about the best case scenario for a sequel; maintaining almost everything that made the first one great and building on it in subtle but interesting ways. the core gameplay loop remains fantastic; doesn’t matter how many corridors you trudge through or rooms you clear — every encounter is incredibly tense and exciting. i missed the sort of heavy clunkiness of the original a bit, but the slightly slicker, more fluid combat has its merits too and is well motivated character-wise: isaac would be a little more adept at dealing with these things by now. found all the new weapons and mechanics to be mostly fantastic; this time around i favored the seeker rifle, which in combination with liberal use of stasis absolutely shreds necromorphs. ridiculous name for them btw, necromorphs lol. the writing in these games is definitely…something. the narrative elements are more foregrounded here which isn’t exactly to its benefit as it’s very silly, rote stuff when approached on that level. but i did find isaac’s internal meltdown over the course of the game to be visceral (😏) and affecting; the visions of nicole are well realized and implemented. hard for me to buy into this as a story about a man overcoming his grief and guilt tho - partly why i found the final boss encounter (and really the only true boss encounter in the game) to be a little anticlimactic, especially compared to the last one - and i still think these games would be better with far less narrative context. let it be about a guy walking around fixing machines and fighting alien zombies and that’s it! this marker mythology shit is whatever to me!! but that’s okay. it doesn’t actually impede the experience in any significant way i just don’t think it’s the ideal package for this gameplay. don’t have much if any complaints beyond that; this series remains some of the very best sci-fi/horror action you can find in any medium',N'2025-02-13'),

The medal hunting kills the pacing of the game if you are just trying to go through the levels, yet the game doesnt really make an effort to tell you to slow down and find all the medals since the quotas are usually manageable on their own before they get spiked for no reason at the very end. The levels are fun as hell though, I dont even really have a problem with the werehog outside of maybe a few werehog levels overstaying their welcome. The game just has a fun vibe to it, I like it. The framerate on the PS3 version also sucks, play the xbox version instead, preferrably on series X where it runs at 60 FPS and is incredible.

It gets a bit easier to get the amount required to complete the game once you unlock the extra acts, but unless you really pay attention as you play the levels, youre going to find yourself replaying them quite a bit if you want to make progress. Eggmanland is one of the most infuriating levels I have played for quite some time. Not only does it have an absurdly big difficulty curve from every other level, but the level drags on longer than the other werehog levels. Considering my lack of skill at Sonic games, Im honestly surprised I managed to beat it, let alone without having to grind for extra lives.

It is impressive how much content they managed to pack into this game, and while that is definitely a strength of this game, it also comes to the games detriment at times IMO. Mostly in due to the fact that the game is longer than the other yakuza games, and the story kinda lags behind because of it. Each character basically has their own unrelated story that ends in a cliffhanger that is resolved in the final chapter, and I dont really think said cliffhanger was worth all the buildup...? idk man, if youve played the series enough to make it this far you already know what you are getting yourself in for, and if you for some reason want to start with this, theres enough content to warrant it still being interesting i guess.

The 5 characters are actually fun to play as (except 1), and the side content of this game is actually the best in the series. The 1 character that isnt fun is just lame and doesnt have very much depth to his style. Saejima actually feels good to play as in this game. Im not sure if they just changed how he felt or I did something wrong in 4 but hes cool now. Akiyama and kiryu are akiyama and kiryu so theyre obviously fun. Hakura was vey unexpected. I mean its a rhythm game breaking up an action beat em up game  yet honestly it works pretty well. The side story minigames were pretty cool (especially kiryus) and a welcome addition, although I didnt do them much because this game took me FOREVER. I wouldve liked to do them more but I was growing impatient and just wanted to finish the game. The story in this game is just okay at best. 4 does the split paths crossing into one much better and all the different stories were just kind of tiring me out at that point. There were some really sweet heartfelt moments here and there but it wasnt enough to make me 100% invested like other games. The music also wasnt as strong as the last game, which isnt a dig at this games music its still good. Just not AS good.

The flutter jump is great to adjust your jumps, the egg shooting is super responsive, and the ground pound is so iconic that even Mario stole it for later entries in his series. The level design compliments these controls well, as the exploratory nature of many of its levels put these skills to perfect use. To be fair, there are a few times where instant death pits and spikes feel unwarranted, but by no means is that much a dealbreaker.\n                     \n                     But not only do the controls hold up, so does this game’s graphics.

Additionally, thanks to the Super FX chip, the 3D graphics are just mindboggling and add to the already impressive graphics for the time. Even today, the graphics still hold up shockingly well and is just a testament to how strong of an impression this game has on its players. Everything to the music to the enemy designs are just so delightful and full of that Nintendo charm.

As one of the earlier Lego games of its kind (along with Complete Saga and Indiana Jones), the hub world is just kind of there in both versions rather than the interesting stuff that would show up later (originally on the sequel to this one), and as such once youve beaten the main games you will get caught on a fair whack of grinding if you dont have the cash to pick up the keys which are required for a lot of free play stuff. Essentially its a fun mindless playthrough but once youve beaten the story it isnt the most engaging to 100%. Though im sure I did it on console as a child, and I also used to know some of the cheats off by heart. Good game and a fun reminisce.',N'2025-09-10'),

But everything else I really enjoyed. The DLCs are some of my favorite and are all REALLY good, and the gunplay is so much better than the first two, as well as the movement. I like the characters you play as since they all have a lot of variety and different builds you can do, and I think the endgame content is insanely good with the DLC. Only other issue I have is that legendaries drop like candy, and it really takes any finding that special, unique item that you worked hard to grind for. They just drop SO much. I think I found fifteen or twenty before I left Pandora. And it is even worse there arent any pearls or things higher than legendary.

Además los encuentros con los otros humanos se sienten como fortuitos y suelen hablar sobre sus miedos, sueños y la visión de su mundo ideal y los problemas que ellos ven con el mundo actual. En resumen tienen menos dialogo que en la saga Persona pero dicen cosas mucho más interesantes, (bajo mi punto de vista).\n                     \n                     El sistema de combate es por turnos y tiene cosas que me gustan y cosas que no.\n                     \n                     Tu equipo esta formado por tu avatar y los demonios que hayas reclutado, los demonios pueden morir en combate y puedes llamar a otro que tengas para sustituirlo, lo unico que gasta un turno. Si se muere tu personaje se acaba la partida y tienes que cargar del último puntonde guardado. Hay ataques de daño que puede ser fisico o magico, y los magicos hay de muchos elementos distintos, y también hay ataques de aumentar tus estadísticas, bajar las del rival, provocar problemas de estado y curar tu salud y/o maná.\n                     \n                     Las acciones que tienes para atacar en tu turno depende de la cantidad de demonios que tengas en el equipo ,máximo 4 acciones, pero pueden aumentar hasta 8 si haces ataques eficaces o criticos, pero también puedes perder acciones si fallas ataques o haces ataques inmunes para tu rivales.\n                     \n                     Y uno de los problemas es que siento que el combate se centra mucho en aumentar tu evasión y reducir la precisión del rival para que el rival falle y asi tu puedas pegar muchas más veces. Lo bueno es que desde la primera zona hay demonios que tienen sukukaja o sukunda que permiten justo eso.\n                     \n                     Tu personaje va aprendiendo tecnicas conforme aumenta de nivel y consigue distintos magatamas, así que es bueno porque tiene mucha personalización, lo malo que los slots de habilidades pasivas y los ataques se comparten por lo que no puedes tener una gran variedad de ataques elementales y habilidades pasivas interesantes. Una cosa que no estoy seguro si se puede hacer o no es recordar movimientos y habilidades que podías haber tenido pero una vez que las has descartado ya no las puedes volver a obtener.\n                     \n                     Los demonios también aprenden ataques aumentando sus niveles solo que están limitados a unos pocos ataques, para tener los que tu quieras es mediante la fusión de demonios con los ataques necesarios.\n                     \n                     Otro problema es sobre las fusiones, me gustaria que fuera más intuitivo o que explicaran en que se basan que demonios hay que fusionar para sacar el que tú quieres, porque me ha pasado que yo queria sacar al Trompetista que es el menora de más alto nivel (78) pero para eso tenia que fusionar a Pazuzu y a Dionisio que tenia ambos al nivel cincuenta alto, mientras tanto los demonios de nivel 70 que tenía con ninguna combinación lo podia sacar.\n                     \n                     Pero salvo eso me gusta que puedan heredar habilidades y si sacrifiques a un tercer demonio puedes también heredar sus habilidades además de sacar al nuevo demonio con uno o varios niveles más alto.\n                     \n                     Por cierto las habilidades de recarga de maná y absorbe maná me parecen las mejores porque te permite llegar al jefe de una mazmorra con los puntos de salud y maná al maximo sin tener que gastar objetos.\n                     \n                     Las mazmorras me gustan la mayoria el diseño que tienen a pesar de tener un estilo muy psicodelico, lo que no me gusta es que algunas se vuelven muy laberínticas porque ponen cosas como teletransportaciones y tienes que aprendertelos de memoria.

(1042, 8,N'Dmc Devil may cry é um jogo bem sólido, com uma das melhores gameplays da série, e as melhores e mais divertidas seções de plataforma. A gameplay é muito boa, com muitos combos fluidos e variedade da armas , como parte fundamental dessa estrutura a troca rápida de armas durante um combo. Porém mesmo sendo um game muito gostoso de jogar , os inimigos não acompanham essa fluidez toda e acabam sendo na esmagadora maioria do jogo apenas sacos de pancadas de combos, o que abaixa e muito a dificuldade do game, o que pode desagradar alguns ( incluindo eu). No geral embora conte com um ou outro inimigo interessante, no geral os inimigos não tem metade do carisma da série principal, o que tbm se reflete um pouco nos poucos chefes do game, na qual  dois em especial são bem criativos e legais , porém os outros não tem o mesmo tempero que a série clássica. Quanto a história aoesar de um Reboot, dá pra perceber o cuidado de contar uma história de início mais consistente e uniforme, diferente da série principal que é uma bagunça tremenda na questão do enredo e cronologia. A história do jogo funciona passando um ar demoníaco mais sujo e pé no chão do que o padrão anime da série original, o que nesse jogo caiu muito bem. Porém acredito que o maior responsável pelo rage que esse jogo sofreu seja seu protagonista Dante, que não tem 20% do carisma do protagonista original, e somada a péssima estratégia de marketing usada na promoção desse jogo na época, apenas reforçaram a aversão ao personagem, o que infelizmente se refletiu na repercussão do game.

It\s always a treat seeing how each will react to different choices on new playthroughs.\n                     \n                     If there\s one thing that really does suck about the game is the lack of support this game gets from EA. I definitely think it needs a remaster way more than Mass Effect ever did. I\d also argue that while most of the key characters looked good at launch, most of the npcs looked pretty rough The sheer amount of mods I have running on this game to make it look good on modern monitors would make most players heads spin. Don\t get me wrong, it\s not like Jade Empire, where it\s totally unplayable without fixes but it\s not exactly the best impression if you just play vanilla. We\ll probably get a remaster someday. I just hope they don\t sand all the edges down in the process though.\n                     \n                     Anyways, DAO is an amazing game I\ve played way too many times and I can\t wait to play many more times.',N'2025-05-09'),

Its an incredibly complex game, but you must dive deep into the warren report to discover that, removing all sense of casualness from the game. At first, I thought the level cap was a neat idea, but even without grinding I ended up spending multiple battles at the cap, constantly fighting an uphill battle against opponents that were perpetually stronger and better equipped than my rag-tag army. To me, this comes across as a lazy attempt at raising the difficulty that subsequently forces me into a box of playing the right solution, suppressing creativity in ones approach as you rely more on exploiting the AI, creating a much more stagnant, repetitive and aggravating experience that becomes an entirely different kind of grind. What I saw of the story was intriguing, but its nowhere near enough to make me want to slog through the rest. The grind has a certain uniqueness that allows tiny incremental gains even at the level cap, but I cant shake the feeling that this just isnt respecting my time. Otherwise, it looks and sounds great. If youre looking for a tactical RPG that you can just pick up and play casually, this certainly isnt it, but if youre up for a challenge and have the time to spare, then Id still say you should give it a go.',N'2024-08-23'),

Something about the little ding when you\ve completely washed something is super satisfying, as is taking a grimy looking house or playground or what have you and seeing it slowly become a nice, brightly-colored environment. There are definitely some flaws in the gameplay and presentation, though; the fact that you can\t rotate equipment as far as I can tell makes using it unnecessarily clunky, and I wish there were different color options for the Dirt Sense because orange occasionally blends in a little too well to be able to see it in some environments. And then sometimes it\s a little too light to be able to detect and you have to just keep washing something until the game tells you it\s clean... but regardless, I still thought it was a very good time accelerator.

It makes a good VC game where you don\t have to put much thought into what you are doing and have something for your hands to do while chatting with friends about things.

The OST goes hard no matter what region you play in, with the japanese/european soundtrack giving more funky vibes whereas the american version gives off a lot of atmospheric serious vibes. Gameplaywise this game is a very directionless little game, since there is this time travel mechanic they got going on where you have to go to the past to fix the future, but you can also collect time stones to get the good futures which makes the whole going into the past thing kinda pointless since its significantly easier to just go for the time stones instead, but then the levels are designed to be wide and open so you can explore them which defeats the purpose of that if you are just gunning it to the end, and can you see now why I said it feels directionless?

As a rule of thumb this tends to be one of my least favorite genres, but this one does more than enough to separate itself from the rest of the pack - thanks in part to the series\ bright personality. If I have one noticeable complaint, it\s that Rayman\s sprite has seldom felt more lifeless than it is here - I assume to account for the good amount of other unlockable characters, which I guess is a relatively fair tradeoff in the end. But other than a couple minor quirks (wall running can be janky and the bubble hitboxes are kind of fucked) I fell in love with it immediately and never wanted to put it down. Rare to find one of these with a satisfying challenge level like this has, not too easy but not too difficult.

Yeah you can change directions in mid-air and whip in multiple directions but I felt like the level design was kinda forgettable (with some exceptional mode7 gimmick levels) and the OST was more of this atmospheric type thing they had going on instead of the more upbeat type of sound id normally expect with castlevania.

And to be honest, until I played through the entire campaign on Switch Online, the only experience I had with this game was from glimpses of my cousins playing through the campaign or from the short bursts of multiplayer theyd allowed me to participate in. Playing through the game, Ive realized how important this game truly is to the higher FPS canon. Non-linear levels based on objectives along with fast-paced gunplay. Varied weaponry that feels so good to maul down enemy combatants as they stalk you relentlessly. A smooth yet intense soundtrack from Grant Kirkhope. The dedication to its source material. Goldeneye is still one of the best movie to game adaptations in history and people who complain about the controls are missing the point. Yes, there are frustrating aspects to the gameplay, but when you get used to it, you realize you can gundown enemies with one hand and sip a glass of whiskey on the rocks in the other; letting the left trigger and the auto aim do the rest. I could’ve made a shaken not stirred martini reference but I don’t know any Bond references that weren’t made in this game. I thought the Moonraker and Golden Gun were from this movie! They aren’t from Goldeneye??!! Thats cool that they added so many references to the whole franchise though even though it was lost on me even now.',N'2025-10-13'),

(1098, 4,N'This game certainly has a legendary status for not only being a catalyst of console FPS games but also for its phenomenal multiplayer where its just plain fun to blast away at your friends and scream at em for screenpeeking and picking oddjob. I had owned this game for years and not even touched the singleplayer mode, so I finally got around to doing the actual campaign and its aight. The controls take some time to get used to for sure but once i got over the learning curve it was very smooth sailing. I think my main gripe with the game is just that I don\t know how the game wanted me to play the whole time. Since the game was initially designed to be a gallery shooter before the devs switched to an FPS, the levels are designed with a lot of choke points where there are a lot of enemies and one way to proceed. Naturally, especially considering this game is a james bond game, the correct move would be to cautiously take out all the enemies before proceeding to the next area. Unfortunately the game continues to spawn enemies infinitely if you decide to stay in one spot too long, so sometimes a better play would be to throw caution to the wind and just run through everyone blasting them like its doom. Due to the fact that it\s hard to tell how the game wants you to play for each level plus the fact that each level is rather open and nonlinear, allowing the player to get lost frequently, it all blends together to create a rather unbalanced gameplay experience. The soundtrack is good, and graphically the environments are very nice looking on the N64, with far draw distances for the system and not too much slowdown. Once again, the multiplayer is some of the most fun you can have on the N64. All in all, great with friends, eh by yourself.',N'2024-01-24'),

(1102, 8,N'Echoes, maybe fittingly for a game split between two worlds, can be equally compelling and frustrating. It engages novel ideas for the franchise — inserting some survival horror mechanics into series that should be ripe for them — and taking on noticeable creative risks with its doubled worlds and augmented difficulty. But it wears out its welcome well before the end with an overlong fetch quest that fails to recapture the flow of the first games artifact hunt, and its world, while atmospheric and gloomy, only really has one aesthetically-arresting zone. Couple that with one of the worst final boss fights Ive ever played and generally overburdened combat throughout, and its a hard game to recommend to anyone who isnt already deep into the series marginalia.',N'2025-05-02'),
(1102, 4,N'Taking pretty much everything the original game did, expanding, and refining it, Prime 2 is simply one of the best games in the entire Metroid franchise. The dichotomy of the Dark World allows the game to keep the backtracking elements Prime 1 was infamous for, but implement them in a way that is significantly less obtrusive and unintuitive. And while it takes a bit to get there, it has some beautiful art direction, with Sanctuary Fortress standing out as incredibly striking and beautiful, and I’m willing to bet it would look even better with an HD remaster like the first game got. Luckily, this game also rectified of Prime 1’s unfortunate flaws, a lack of an ending escape timer, and it does it in a great and memorable way, having you face off against Dark Samus in one of the coolest confrontations in the series while on the clock to the entire Dark Aether dimension being destroyed. Overall, this is an undeniable classic that anyone who is interested in Metroid should get around to playing.',N'2025-08-28'),
(1102, 6,N'1 step forward, 1.01 steps back. Ultimately Prime 2 is still an utterly fantastic game, but it just doesn\t reach the same highs as Prime 1.\n                     \n                     Like Prime, Echoes\s atmosphere is top-notch. Rather than aiming for a lonely atmosphere like Prime, Echoes aims for a significantly more oppressive and terrifying feel, and it absolutely succeeds. The Dark Aether areas are genuinely unsettling at times, with their Silent Hill-esque music and body-horror visual design.\n                     \n                     It\s hard to really elucidate what makes Echoes a little less great than Prime, but I think it really comes down to the backtracking. I know lmao Echoes backtracking is a meme, but it really does drag the game out longer than it needs to. In particular, returning to the Temple Grounds after every main area and the Sky Temple key hunt during the endgame are the biggest culprits.\n                     \n                     The much higher level of difficulty is also a point of contention in the community, but I always found Prime 1 to be a little too easy, to Echoes\s greater challenge is welcome in my eyes. The final boss in particular was an excellent challenge.\n                     \n                     Overall, Echoes is still an excellent game despite not being quite as good as Prime 1, and in my eyes is nonetheless a worthy sequel that adds almost as much as it subtracts from Prime 1.',N'2024-08-15'),

(1109, 3,N'The year was 2014, back when Donkey Kong Country was still a household name. My first time experiencing Fire Emblem was through my sister recommending me to check out Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, citing it as a creation made by the team behind Super Paper Mario, which we loved dearly. Using the power of emulation, I got it completely playable on Dolphin, where she took the helm and played it the whole way through. And surely, Intelligent Systems was indeed responsible for making one of the most riveting tales told on the GCN, 2nd behind Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door. A lot of people see this as the quintessential Fire Emblem game, as well as the peak. It gets close, but I think the reason why people deem that is because of its heightened fantasy elements. Instead of having only Manaketes as supposed “sub-humans” which is a funny play on racism, the Manaketes were renamed to Dragon Laguz, because that’s what they are, essentially. Laguz are humanoid creatures that can turn into either Lynxes, Saber Toothed Tigers, Lions, Crows, Hawks, White Herons, and of course, Dragons. Despite there being 3 Laguz nations, I actually listed every Laguz species I could think of, which shows how memorable this game is. Now compare that to Berwick Saga, released the exact same year. Berwick Saga has only Dragons, where they are nearly extinct and could’ve been written out of Berwick Saga entirely, considering they were used to explain the past of Berwick’s world, which is far cooler, in my opinion. Not that the added fantasy elements to FE9 are bad, it just feels a little off to me, considering your opponent in FE9 is still a human “Beorc” nation with a refined Imperial Army, with Izuka experimenting on how to use the Laguz to Daein’s advantage, a concept which came to fruition in FE10 and was one of the many good things that game pulled off despite the overambition. I remember my sister and I watching this cutscene from FE9 in 2014, where my father literally asked me how the heck this great red lion turned into a man, and I couldn’t help but think about how silly this 2005 CG cutscene looked when I first saw it.',N'2025-02-28'),

The game does a very good job at tying your game progression to the story as finding all the castaways fits perfectly with the exploration. The castaways arent just for the story as they can grant you access to items or other services as well as the ability to eliminate roadblocks in the world.

It is not without fault mind you, buggy textures, wobbly writing, they somehow made Blade more annoying than Captain Marvel, weirdness like that. However, the gameplay is really sublime. I originally felt the card format would be a hinderance towards what I was seeing as the main innovation, the lack of tile movement, but have been proven quite wrong. The game so excellently subdues its RNG to a degree quite unlike the former X-COM devs I know and despise, the game plays like a card game of sorts, with the explosive always just off of OTKs you achieve and the deckbuilding I always appreciate. The difficulty scaling is for the most part, rather fantastic, with my current playthrough having just recently reached max difficulty. It\s hard to go so in-depth without this all devolving into a bunch of disjointed points so I\ll try to give my overall opinion: It\s a pretty good game that is so distinctly of this era. (writing/game design trends) However, where it trend chases, it feels weak, and I feel that it if it focused on the core of the game, it would be significantly better. However on that however, a part of me feels an over-tuned version of what I like in the game, could very likely make another X-COM2.

Since I played the original version, I did not have access to the auto-aim system that’s found in the Director’s Cut and Dualshock versions which made enemy encounters a lot more difficult than they needed to be. You could argue that this does enhance the horror aspects of this game, making you feel powerless against these monsters, however, it felt less like an intentional choice and more of a fault with the gameplay. Puzzles aren’t as tricky or archaic as I thought they were going to be. Every puzzle is fairly obvious and there are plenty of clues barring a few instances but for a PS1 puzzle game, that is an accomplishment. The story is total non-sense thanks to the terrible voice-acting but despite this, I could still get invested in these characters. There’s enough intrigue where I felt interested in this game’s plot despite of its flaws that I’m actually excited to play its sequels. If you’re going to play RE1 for the PlayStation, just play the later editions as they fix many flaws found with this version.',N'2024-10-19'),

Despite taking many music tracks and race circuits from R4, it never felt quite as impactful. The overall R4 aesthetic molded by the games UI design, graphical look, and music is timeless. Going through the Grand Prix races always felt intense and engrossing, and a big part of that is because of the aforementioned aesthetic.

(1159, 3,N'Not gonna lie, as a big fan of the behemoth and having loved both alien hominid and castle crashers, I had high expectations for this game. However, upon actually playing it, the core gameplay was a really lukewarm 2D platformer with not a lot of interesting theming going on with its levels to keep me engaged. The level design was good but the aesthetics had real level editor vibes to it, i guess. The one thing holding the game together are the infinitely entertaining cutscenes between worlds, they killed it with those. But I think this game is partly due to blame for why I didn\t really bother even trying the Behemoth\s latest projects. Castle crashers and alien hominid were both really good examples of the beat em up and run n gun genres, and this game didn\t pull the same weight with its genre.',N'2025-04-09'),

Their dreams would have to wait a few years though, as when Ni no Kuni: Domain of the Dark Djinn was released in 2010, it was a Japan exclusive. But worldwide fans of the concept finally got their wish in 2013, when Bandai Namco produced a worldwide release for the Playstation 3.

I think that the beginning was extremely strong, with great additions such as hurdling, augments, the My Hero Academia collab, and Winterfest (although Winterfest wasnt that amazing this past year, it was still notable). However, as time went on, this season just began to completely fall apart. It was evident that some things were just genuinely broken, with so many features (including the aforementioned hurdling) being vaulted only to either never return or return months later. I really think they planned this season poorly and loaded up the first month with an insane amount of content and made up the rest as they went along, including the very thematically out-of-place heist event later in the season. It was still enjoyable for the first month and towards the end, but the large barren gap with no content in the middle really hurt this season gameplay-wise, and I just began to grow really tired of it. The Battle Pass was good, though. Geno, Doomguy, and Geralt are all top-tier skins.

(1171, 3,N'A fun continuation of what Symphony of the Night did, but a little bit more scaled down to be on a portable. Exploring Draculas castle is as fun as always, the music kicks ass, and the powerups you find for defeating bosses are always fun to use. However, I didnt really like the way items were handled in this game. Drop rates are incredibly low, and there is no shop so duplicate pieces of equipment become pointless. There are also these cards that you can combine to give yourself various effects, and those cards are also locked behind random enemy drops. I would have liked it more if the cards were something you naturally found around the map rather than something that you have to grind for. The last bit of the game becomes a bit of a slog, with the second to last boss being in a particularly annoying to reach area and the final boss being really cheaply designed imo.

(1176, 10,N'Super underrated but still flawed for sure. Probably the best thing is the atmosphere this game makes. Theres such an eerie, claustrophobic feeling you get plunging deep into the caverns of an alien world, hunting for metroids that are gradually becoming stronger and more horrifying as you progress. And the ending sequence is incredibly cinematic and terrifying for a Game Boy game from 1991.

It feels pretty atmospheric with some interesting music and you do feel like youre descending into this scary alien planet. Unfortunately, the lack of map and all the environments looking very similar (especially when it never got a colour version for the GBC) make it incredibly difficult to navigate. I know getting lost can sometimes be the point of these games but when you cant discern one area from another, it just becomes a frustrating experience.

The misadventures of the Prince of Sable (Note that hurts me to write: the Assist Trophy guy that turns into a frog) got me thinking about how the consoles library tends to stick out from a lot of Nintendos usual lineup. I was originally going to write something longer about that game itself, pointing to how Game Boy games having a smaller technical scope, and perhaps a looser leash than their console counterparts, could enable them to explore more unique narratives. In particular, the role of the protagonist is oddly subversive across the library. The aforementioned and often incompetent Prince of Sable, the way in which the\n                     \n                      Mario Land\n                     \n                     series was supplanted by its own antagonist, or even the bittersweet nature of Links quest in\n                     \n                      Links Awakening\n                     \n                     . But I could never really get beyond that thesis statement. Sure, I could point out how telling it was that the Prince had to buy his own transformation items, but nothing ever came together in an interesting way.',N'2025-04-19'),
(1177, 8,N'Shenmue is definitely a game that will never be made again, and I mean that in both a good and a bad way. The amount of attention to detail that this game had in 1999 is unparalleled for it\s time. It truly is Yu Suzuki\s magnum opus as he decided to create a virtual living breathing community of people, and in a lot of ways he succeeded. Because of the less traditional approach that was made to create this game, a less traditional mindset needs to be had to really enjoy this kind of game ngl. I think a good modern equivalent would be something like death stranding, a game where if you are able to slow down to the pace that the game asks of you, there\s a lot to be had in the sort of atmospheric sense, but if you are going into the game expecting to play it like any other game, focusing on major goals and objectives as skillfully and efficiently as possible, then you are probably gonna be really bored and frustrated at the game. And that\s not me trying to say if you have that kind of mindset, you wouldn\t understand shenmue, but more me saying this game is not for everyone and you should definitely know that going in if you want to experience this game to its fullest. You gotta play on the game\s terms, and not really on your own, in that sense. The gameplay just revolves asking people various things to get various hints on where to go next, and once you go to the next place you ask the people in that place where to go, and the cycle continues until you piece together the greater picture of whats going on. My reccomendation is just to give it a shot, and you will probably know within the first few hours whether or not the game is for you.',N'2025-03-28'),

The puzzles I mostly to be enjoyable but some took a bit of time. The enemies in this game were probably the most annoying part.

I also dont think the 3D world control style and powerup system works too well for a more sandbox type of mario game. Your movement options dont feel as flexible as something like Super Mario Odyssey which feels uncomfortable at times for this game.

The camera also has a hard time keeping up with the action at times. I also think most of the bosses are completely uninteresting. In character action games (I despise this term) the bosses are usually a big highlight, but here you get an electric worm, then two electric worms, then a fire worm, two tanks, a helicopter and a tentacle monster you fight multiple times. This game also commits one of my personal pet peeves and that is boss fights with added trash mobs. Off the top of my head two bosses on normal are like this, but on harder difficulties way more do this, like most of the bosses.

The garden simply doesnt provide as much of the bare necessities, and the vendors and their prices are too seldom and random to be as meaningful as they probably should be.   Run-of-the-mill simple potions frequently eat up basic ingredients and tumble the balancing act against exploring the map and hunting down new ones for the more demanding patrons. A solid improvement would be to include a static vendor that might sacrifice a day of patrons without a status or moral penalty, but lets you buy out a fixed amount of basic ingredients youd like to have on hand, or better yet a methodology around upgrading the magic garden to increase the amount of those basic ones.',N'2024-10-23'),

For every bullshit thing the game throws at you, the game gives you quadruple the amount of bullshit to use against the enemy - like there are so many brave and master weapons and staves that basically get handed to you on a silver platter, and while there are a few chapters that are trial and error, actually figuring them out genuinely feels so good - no other Fire Emblem game gives me this much dopamine. Hell, I made a long ass text file documenting my experiences with the game, going in depth on every strategy I utilised in every chapter and giving pointers and advice that either myself or someone else could use whenever they decide to play.

Shouzou Kaga was evidently opposed to making a Fire Emblem game on the N64, believing the 3D graphics would hurt the appearance of his characters, and that philosophy to keep the characters 2D carried over to the PS1’s Tear Ring Saga: Yutona Heroes War Chronicles. That too went well, but let’s focus on FE5.',N'2025-11-10'),
(1254, 6,N'This game probably took about 10 years from my lifespan but i still loved it, the infamous difficulty of the game is actually really satisfying and well balanced especially in the first half, but after chapter 18 or so is.... painful, to say the least. Still, after strategizing for hours, constantly saving and loading states and rage moments,sense of accomplishment i get from beating a stage from a 24 year old SRPG is remarkable\n                     \n                     Probably my favorite aspect about FE5 is the overall tone of it. While FE4 had it\s fair share of dark moments, this game is straight up depressing, you actually feel how bleak and despair the situation is in every chapter. By the beggining of the game, you feel completely lost,and confused by the mechanics and the difficulty, just like Leif, feeling lost on this brutal war. You are not a group of experienced and heroic knights, leading for victory, you are mostly common folk going against a full fledged empire, and you\re obviously going to get obliterated against such force. But as you learn the mechanics of the game and gain strong units, a hope slowly rises, and you go from how the hell am i going to survive from this? to Hey, i can actually do this! and you start to command larger armies on bigger maps. And then, you are facing with the strongest forces of the Empire. It\s actually even harder then before, but you have so much more experince with the game,you don\t feel as powerless as before. And after you\ve gone through so much, beating the game and seeing those credits rolled is one of the most rewarding feelings a game can give to you\n                     \n                     This, is phenomenal storytelling, and you can only have this in a videogame, that unforgiving difficulty is one of the finest examples of storytelling through gameplay. That\s why remake of this game is probably going to suck, since they\ll inevatiabely tone down the difficulty.\n                     \n                     Gameplay has a surprising amount of resource management, and i love this, you can capture enemies to steal their equipment,but it\s significantly harder and risky to do,since you\ll deal much less and take much more damage. But since you don\t get much chance to buy and repair weapons, you really have to pay attention the resources you have, and use them in the most efficient way to overcome challenges you face\n                     \n                     Fatigue is also a new mechanic, which if you use a unit too much, you won\t be able to use them in the next chapter, which makes powerful units more tricky to use, adding another depth to the gameplay. You\ll only want to use them when necessary, so you actually have a reason to use less powerful units, i gotta say this was hard to get used to, especially after i obliterated every enemy with Ayra and Larcei in FE4, but it didn\t took long to for me to actually like it\n                     \n                     Also fantastic map designs suplements the complex gameplay mechanics brilliantly. FE5 abandons the massive maps of FE4 in favor of smaller, but focused maps with multiple objectives, and while some enemy placements made me want to torn apart my bone structure from my skin(those goddamn ballistas will give me nightmares) for the most part i really apprecieted the variety in both the map design and objectives. You have defense, escape, fog of war(which isn\t THAT bad in my opinion) and of course normal seize missions. Also each map has it\s own unique objective, which makes every single map even more memorable. Varied objectives makes each chapter fresh, which is something i\ve never seen in an SRPG\n                     \n                     Weakest part of this game imo are the characters, in FE4, you have a lot of optional conversations between characters, and those conversations actually give a decent personality and development to each unit, in FE5, most of the cast has 5 lines of dialogues at most, and all of them are in the chapter you recruit them.\n                     \n                     But i really like how the game tells what happened to them after the credits rolled\n                     \n                     Though this doesn\t mean that this game has no good character writing, far from it, Leif is one the best written main character\s i\ve ever seen in a game. Like i mentioned before, you start of the game as powerless, and with zero knowledge on the complex mechanics of the game. Just like Leif, who\s a 15 year old who has never commanded an army. This is obviously no coincidence, Leif represents the player, but unlike most games that have a main character which isrepresenting the playerLeif isn\t a silent protagonist, his development from an inexperienced kid to a mature war commander is very natural, and paralells brilliantly with the development of you as a player, as you understand how the game works and start using the tools you have in the most optimal ways. Leif alone is enough to say this game has fantastic character writing\n                     \n                     I\m not sure if Fire Emblem 5 is better than 4,but still, this is one the finest SRPG\s ever made. It\s frusturating for sure, but it\s so well designed in nearly every aspect, it\s impossible for me to hate it. I\d highly recommend it if you liked FE4, and simply want to see more from this world.',N'2024-08-22'),

The NoAH additions, such as the character routes, really help the game feel like the fully realised experience it was meant to be originally. I cant say I thought they were all bangers, but the depth they add, along with what they add to the gameplay experience overall, helps give a sense of thematic finality, if that makes sense.

Its not your standard RPG fare, rather a base-building simulator, similar to the ant farm like layout from games like XCOM.

There are microtransactions, which I hate that they even exist in gaming, but its definitely a lot less greedy here as they dont shove it in your face every five minutes. I played 67 hours of this, got my platinum and I never spend a single cent on Microtransactions or felt I had to, as the game gives you lootboxes at a good rate from just natural gameplay.

However, it relies on flat and boring characters and it really feels half baked. The city is neat, but somewhat uninspired.

I believe this is honestly one of the scariest space horror games ever created.\n                     \n                     The audio design in this game is godlike, serving both the mood and the gameplay, as if you\re perceptive, you can guess who\s on the otherside of a door, or if an event is about to take place.\n                     \n                     The drones are unreliable and pretty brittle, but are modular and can be equipped with different abilities like a turret, a motion sensor, or a computer interface. These loadouts give you the tools to tackle different parts of the ship you\re looting, and can impact how you respond to situations. It\s this slow, tense crawl throughout the ship as you try to gauge what rooms are safe and what are to be avoided, where anything at any given moment can go wrong. A pipe could burst, a meteor could smash into the room, an airlock could open sending anything and everything not anchored into space, or an enemy could crawl through a vent and start wrecking your dudes. Thankfully, many of these situations can be risk mitigated with game knowledge and experience, one a good rougelike has to have in order to keep players coming back.\n                     \n                     How you see the world is either through a map or a top down drone view, and you can either control drones through the terminal, or pilot an individual one manually. It\s a bit obtuse, but it\s implemented deliberately as to not be overbearing. In moments of relative ease, it\s not an issue. But once something unexpected happens and you need to get your drones out fast, you need to be able to know how to get every drone where you want it as fast as possible. Thankfully, there\s some command shortcuts like exit, which sends your buddies booking for the exit, and you can also macro sets of commands if you really want to optimize things. It really adds to the tension, and one unexpected situation can make an inexperienced drone operator lose his entire team.\n                     \n                     It\s been ages since I\ve played this game, but I really want to get back into it. This game is criminally underrated, and I can\t recommend it enough to anyone who is a fan of Rougelikes, horror, and strong atmosphere.',N'2025-11-08'),
(1315, 2,N'The crown jewel of mid budget games. Remedy as a studio have continuously put up some of the most consistently interesting games around, and even with their continued success, they never quite gave up their identity ever since the first Max Payne game. Control continues in the footsteps of its predecessors by providing an incredibly unique world and concept alongside with it, but keeps around the traits that has made the studio what it is today. FMVs, real bands backing their biggest action set pieces, coffee, returning actors, and at least ten or so Twin Peaks homages. Now that Control has set in motion the idea that just about all the Remedy projects all take place in the same world, these games really do have a real cozy feeling to them that is very rare to achieve, and even more impressive considering the tone that Control goes for is pure liminal. Control might just be one of the best looking modern games period, and a true showcase as to how simplicity can achieve spectacular results. The brutalist architecture of The Oldest House gives way for lighting and camera tricks to take center stage, and it creates some of the most striking visuals I’ve ever seen in a game. The game’s biggest set piece is literally one texture repeated on all the walls, and yet it manages to convey such a bizarre and awesome atmosphere as you blast away through it to the sound of Poets of the Fall.',N'2024-08-15'),

(1340, 8,N'a well-meaning but ultimately underwhelming attempt at giving sony a super smash brothers equivalent. Unlike a lot of other criticisms towards the game, I think that the roster isnt exactly the worst. Yeah, theres no crash, spyro, solid snake, or cloud, but they got a lot of other interesting games represented by both characters and stages, which is honestly really cool in the same way getting an unknown thing in smash is. You get to learn a lil bit more about sonys various IPs that you might not have otherwise known, I guess. Gameplaywise though this is definitely not smash brothers. You can only score points and defeat players by using super moves which makes most of the actual fighting kinda feel like irrelevant filler...? The game also lacks the special level of polish and attention to detail that nintendo puts in smash as well, which just makes the overall experience underwhelming. However, Id still say this is worth at least a curious play, since especially with modern sony being the party poopers that hate fun with the playstations legacy of IPs, we aint seeing most of the first-party characters in this game ever comin back. Its kinda like nintendo land in like getting that last little table scrap of content for neglected IPs that I enjoy.

I much prefer playing an actual game with a narrative rather than completing daily tasks in some free-to-play time-sink so these little ports that Square Enix, especially, are putting out are perfect. Dragon Quest is so primo, too. There’s a lot of simplicity in this first one but that just makes it perfect for portability because it just doesn’t need thought put into it; you grind against monsters for levels and gold and the map is small enough to keep track of. You just work toward the next best items and explore all the dungeons for better stuff and then kill the guy!

It proves the efforts, and time I spent in it. The difficulty spikes are there, if you arent prepared for sure, but thats the fun of it. There are many different kind of Digimon, and you dont have to set your team as you can use whatever you would like. Assuming you grind them up, hehe. Thats really cool! Also the exploring. Oh man - I cant say much about it, it just feels good. I hate it normally, but this was another experience I like. I had to look quite often on the map, and guides, but with some help its manageable.

(1347, 0,N'I have complicated feelings on this one. Of course, the presentation is fantastic. I think I am a bit spoiled having played 13 Sentinels first, though. The faces are barely animated at all in this one, and while I think it works for characters like Odin, it does not do any favors for characters like Mercedes and Oswald. It makes everything they say feel a bit sarcastic (though this is not a jab at the english VA, I liked it quite a bit). Far and away my biggest problem with this game is the structure. Each “book” has you playing as a different character, who all play pretty different, though being me I gravitated towards the nigh-uncontrollable flippy-dippy melee fighters. But with these characters, you are going through the same 8ish areas, fighting the same 30ish enemies, ending with one of the same 10ish bosses in each level, and it gets old really fast. I understand these assets probably cost a ton to produce and reusing them is resourceful, but it is so much padding. It negatively impacts the story too. Its a great, simple concept: viewing the lives of the children of these classic fantasy archetypes, with the conclusion that they are pretty much all horrible parents. However, it feels forced to go in certain directions just so I can fight the damn blue worm dragon for like the 5th book in a row. Not all of it is bad, I love seeing little details in one book heavily expanded and explained in another book (like seeing why Pooka ran the food store in book 1 explained in book 2). However, while it would require pretty extensive rewrites, I would’ve preferred a 10-15 hour game reusing less gameplay elements rather than a 35 hour journey that feels pretty tiring by the middle of book 3. I wish I could’ve liked it more, but it feels very forced into a structure that doesn’t benefit it.',N'2025-02-08'),

While being not a classic shooter, or, for example, Serious Sam clone, like Painkiller, it still speedy and action driven.\n                     \n                     The game also have pretty visuals for UE3 engine.

It just don\t go deep into universe, giving lots of stuff to your imagination. But what there is there.

But I can see if you are looking for a more traditional sonic experience why it could be disappointing. I think that the game has some really interesting level themes like the gene gadget and rusty ruin zones, as well as more traditional grass/ice/lava levels. The OST is also absolutely fantastic. The original programmer of the game, Jon Burton, made his own romhack enhancing the control and adding new features such as super sonic and a map screen which is super cool, and you should probably play that if you have the ability to.

This game is basically an N64 Mario Party game but on the Gamecube, so that is honestly pretty cool.

The battle boards from 3 are also completely gone, seems like that stuff was a one-off thing. Anyways, its Mario Party.

It basically does what you expect. Really whether or not you should blast this or 2 just comes down to preference, since 2 is just 1 but with less hand pain, and this has entirely different minigames than 2 does. As a single player experience, it is kinda repetitive as well as the fact that winning mario party games is largely RNG based, so sometimes the AI will just curbstomp you without you being able to do much about it. There are also unique duel maps that have an interesting different game mode attatched to them where you have partners fight each other and what not. All in all, its mario party. This is also the only N64 mario party to have waluigi and daisy, so fans of those characters should pick this over 2. Also this game has most of the actual mario voices instead of the weird voices that were in the first 2 games as well, so its definitely a different vibe. Probably the strongest in the classic trilogy.',N'2024-10-01'),

It was the first full post-war World War II decade that began the information age that we are still currently living in, marked by a greater emphasis on progressing social changes and the quality of human life once we maximized exploration and industry production in decades prior. The economic boom created by the impact of WWII ushered in an era of prosperity, and it seemed like the American dream had come true. Squeaky-clean, conservative values defined the idyllic society that the 1950s upheld: waspy nuclear families where dad wore a suit and tie to his 9 to 5, and mom stayed home all day making dad dinner and cleaning the house. At the same time, little Timmy played baseball with his friends, and little Susie played with her dolls. Not only was the American dream of the 1950s eerily pristine, but it was also boring. Even the leather-jacketed, rock-and-roll counterculture seems like a quaint facet of the decade, or maybe we have Fonzie to thank for making a mockery of it. To retain this halcyon society, the 1950s upheld a strong sense of conformity with zero leeway for any abstract thought or anything outside the very anglo-centric, heteronormative bubble encapsulating the decade. Extreme examples include the Red Scare and all of the anti-gay propaganda. Jim Crow segregation was still in full effect! Fortunately, we’ve progressed substantially past this point in our history. Because the ideals of the 1950s seem antiquated and corny, the decade is ripe for being made fun of. Five decades later, Destroy All Humans! serves as a lampoon of 1950’s culture in the medium of gaming.',N'2025-02-27'),

Id say the quality of the setlist is about the same between the first and second games, but this one luckily doesnt have any green grass and high tides so that gives this games setlist the slight edge. A lot of songs are in guitar hero world tour so dont play those two games back to back like I did otherwise you will get sick and tired of a few songs. The biggest improvement this game has over the first one is you can do the campaign as a single-player experience as well as customize each individual band member and even make a band logo which is neat. Other than that though, Rock Band do be Rock Band. Me and my brother teamed up to relay through the endless setlist on expert to get both the bladder of steel achievement and the platinum artist trophy on the same go, so thats something Ill always remember.',N'2025-09-17'),

The older games are much more strategic in what you needed to use and how to do it, this one is very straightforward instead. This does lead to balance that is clearly towards light ACs, no matter what I did I could never make a quad AC work as well as my simple super lightweight AC, specially since heavy weapons, such as the back cannon, have very heavy recoil that stops you on your tracks, and not moving 24/7 like its fucking Doom Eternal is an objectively bad strategy. Theres also a lot less parts than the previous installments, for example theres only around 6 heavy back weapons, 2 quad legs and 2 tank threads. Nonetheless, I can excuse some of these changes as the game is very different from previous installments like I mentioned. Even the plot is different, having less of a feel towards being a simple mercenary and more of being a heroic soldier.\n                     \n                     Overall, it is an interesting take on the series, and I do wonder what will For Answer be like.',N'2024-02-28'),
(1388, 7,N'Armored Core 4 is a very interesting title. Starting with this iteration the franchise took a radical departure from the slower more methodical gameplay of the previous entries in favor of a much faster pace and more streamlined mechanics.

(1388, 6,N'Armored Core 4 is a radical departure from the previous games in both the way the game is played and presented especially with Miyazaki on his debut as the director. While customization isnt as deep as before, missions are short and the environments feel like a step behind, the moment-to-moment gameplay is really fun and felt like a step in the right direction as the series moved to a new generation. The satisfaction of completing a level is also complemented to the story, more notably the player mercenary/operator relationship developing as you finish each mission. The story was also nice and had some signs of greatness, but I feel like it could have elevated to something better if not for a few missteps. The soundtrack bangs as expected from an AC game. Definitely recommend this one and it also runs well on  an emulator.',N'2025-07-07'),

Bosses also function a lot better here, suffering much less from being stuck on the same spot for an infinite amount of time (aka Spark Mandrill Syndrome), now with an invincible enrage state where they do a mechanic that the player is forced to dodge around. Not only that, but when you do get damaged your HP bar still maintains a bit of the damage you took as Red, so if you swap your character out you can regenerate a bit of health (much like MVC, for instance!),I also really like that the chip mechanic swaps out finding heart tanks in the stages, specially considering the micromanagement of 3 different characters would become hell.\n                     \n                     Now, I praised most of MMX\s stories before, but they were always a bit undercooked. X5 and X6 had a bit more to themselves, sure, but it suffered from bad translations, etc. X8 just.... feels so mature. It talks about this new generation of reploids replacing the old one, the cast being treated as somewhat obsolete by those Reploids, and what does it mean to become a Maverick. Is it a virus or do Reploids just have that free will to know what\s best for them? These are themings that I\d expect from a Yoko Taro game, not a MMX one.\n                     \n                     The soundtrack is so pristine, it shocks me how diverse it feels. I\d say oh go listen to Jakob Elevator or to the boss theme, but... Gateway truly feels like the right pick.

(1405, 3,N'Pretty fun RPG with 108 recruitable players so there\s a lot of customization in parties, until you have to include certain members in your party. The Rune system is simple, but it\s still pretty enjoyable even if the main character basically has a win now Rune which kind of breaks battles. Regular battles go by rather quickly because each character\s turn flows into the others so well (as long as you\re not spamming Runes). I only Game Overed once due to lack of planning, but the game is pretty easy all things considered. My biggest complaint is the lack of diverse battle music. There\s really only 2 battle tracks the whole game, and the movement speed sans True Holy Rune is kind of a slog. There\s a lot of backtracking to get all 108 Stars of Destiny and the inventory management is... Less than stellar. The variety of battle styles is really neat and a fun idea, but the large scale battles are easy to cheese. It\s a fun RPG to run through with quite a bit of customization with parties which increases replayability.',N'2025-01-24'),

Obviously the animated opening and the music are far too advanced, but the game doesnt really look to impressive outside of the occasional cool sprite animation and the dynamic battle camera. When viewed from the lens of modernity, the stuff this game pulled off which likely seemed exciting at the time are no longer very impressive. I was 2 in 1995, so maybe Im wrong, but the big features seem to be the size of the playable cast, the inclusion of large-scale battles, and the cinematic battle scenes. I already briefly touched on that last one, and it certainly looks cool for a bit, but it doesnt necessarily carry the otherwise simplistic combat you will spend many hours in.',N'2025-05-07'),

(1407, 7,N'this was the first smt game i have ever beaten fully (not counting persona) and it will probably remain one of my favorite smt games ever, as a fan of strategy rpgs already the gameplay appealed to me. the objectives for maps are diverse and fun, despite the maps being fairly simple the variety of objectives and layouts made it fun anyways. the games difficulty was fine, though there are some fights i dislike. the story is fantastic. the scenario is immediately interesting and a lot of things happen very quickly which gets you hooked. the characters are all enjoyable and i felt bad when i missed a chance to talk to one of them. the time management system is pretty neat too. i have only finished amanes route but the characters are all compelling and the best part of the game to me is that when it came down to the point of picking my route, i saw equal merit in all choices (except yuzus sorry yuzu youre still the number 1). usually in smt games there is a true ending, and when theres not, it usually seems like chaos is always the better option, but in devil survivor i truly had trouble deciding which route i agreed with. the game also makes your choices matter, not thinking ahead with your dialogue options and actions will result in the deaths of multiple characters, and i like that. it made it feel like your decisions each day had weight. as for the parts of the game i dont like, its beldr. he is basically the minotaur of devil survivor but beldr doesnt teach the player anything. he can only be killed by the protagonist with 1 specific physical move (physical being the worst attacking type in the game by far). the only thing i could say it teaches the player is to focus on objectives, but still thats a stretch. other than that all the fights were fun the mechanics are fun. the auction system being the only way of getting demons is a bit annoying, but overclocked fixes this. i would say this is a must play if you are a fan of smt and strategy rpgs (FUCK SHARP FE THIS IS THE REAL SMT X FE CROSSOVER)\n                     \n                     (also play overclocked i played the ds version but im sure overclocked improves on the game wholly)',N'2024-09-04'),

One way they could have done shooting was like Ratchet & Clank just having some sort of Crosshair, the thing is the way they made 3D just does not work at all they made the camera look up instead of behind the player yk like how a fucking 3D game that works, and the thing is the 2D doesn’t even fucking work in this game with enemies still acting in a 3D environment It makes it a pain in the ass dealing with enemies that the lock-on barely works with enemies that are in the background or foreground it’s so fucking bad and makes me realize that X7 has the most bland level design when it comes to 2D legit the last stages are almost as difficult as the opening stages from X1-6 it’s really dumb and ridiculously easy for it, honestly i could go on with the story, character misinterpretation or newcomers (i fucking hate Axl), but im just tired of talking about this game this is the most dogshit game I have played and if you want to be like me and play every X game please just skip this game If you want to play the Mega Man X games because they are something I really adore I’m just really upset at how Capcom treats MM no matter if It’s a subseries or not.',N'2025-03-13'),

Each level is a hub which branches off to other locations like Hexen, but isnt as overly confusing as that game was.

I think out of all the Final Fantasy games Ive played, this one has the best world building. I completely understood not only the struggle the characters were going through but how their society evolved to reach that point and what their motivations were on a macro scale, I really like it. I also really like the combat and leveling system of this game; anytime a game branches away from the plain old EXP yields levels yields a stat boost system, Im a fan. You can switch out party members on the fly based on the enemies? Great! Theres a leveling system where you can branch off to prioritize the ability and stat upgrades you want? Great! There are a few downsides. Some of the characters were a bit goofy, particularly Tidus and Yuna, and I think most of that is due to their poor voice direction. Also, while the main villain of Jecht/Sin is really interesting, I found Seymour to be horribly bland and vastly overstayed his welcome.',N'2024-09-22'),

Most of the characters are fleshed out incredibly well and its the game in the series to sell the romance.  The great soundtrack is one of Uematsu\s best, really punctuates the great story moments, To Zanarkand being one of the most meloncholic yet unforgettable songs. Combat is great, having a order timeline and the ability to swap party members mid battle introduces a ton of flexibility.  Blitzball is alright, not as good as previous card games but it fits into the world so well.  The only thing i dislike is the sphere grid, normally its a fine way to level up stats but going for the plat it becomes a real chore to fill it out completely.

(1460, 1,N'Falls short of the perfection of something like the Hotline Miami games, but for what its worth Ruiner puts in a good effort. This is by no means a bad game, just a potentially great one let down in a few key areas. It typically plays great, and the core loop is very fun and polished, outside of a slight overreliance on giving all the enemies a teleporting dash in the later areas to artificially increase difficulty. I get doing that for a few special enemies but Im not sure it makes much sense for like heavy minigun guys to be dashing all over the place as well. Also, the visuals are a bit too bland for my liking. I get what they are going for here, with the stark red lighting in the seedy crime dens and industrial underground factories in which you carry out your violent missions, but it becomes stale by around the halfway point. The look and design of the world are clearly inspired by Katsuhiro Otomos Akira, so its a shame that the overreliance on a constant red and black color palate diminishes Ruiners ability to live up to the beauty of that films visuals. Im sure this sort of thing works for some, if not most people but it did occasionally become an annoyance in my playthrough. As for the story, its generally tolerable but never truly interesting or well-presented. thats fine, it doesnt ever overstay its welcome and can be easily ignored outside of maybe the very underwhelming ending. The one aspect of Ruiner that I did feel was truly perfect was the music, the score fits the gameplay and tone just right and every track sounds great. This isnt quite great and I would never recommend it over something like Hotline Miami or even Furi, but for what it is, its very fun to play.',N'2024-02-10'),

(1474, 5,N'And with this entry, I think my interest in any future Shantae games has ended.\n                     \n                     The first game was a hidden gem released too late on the GBC, so while it was flawed and frustrating, it kind of got a pass. We all thought that it had promise and it sure was unfortunate that the GBA version never manifested.\n                     \n                     The second game (Risky\s Revenge) was more like a tech demo than an actual game, but releasing it as DSiWare meant that it didn\t need to really be more of that. In the end, it had a bit of overworld, two dungeons, and a weirdly boring shmup section before the final boss. (No joking; I played through this game twice, several years apart, and I literally dozed off during the mermaid shmup part both times.) Truly, this series just needed a chance to get a new, REAL, release that would let it stretch its psuedo-Metroidvania wings and be an amazing game!\n                     \n                     Well, we more-or-less got that with Pirate\s Curse. While the Metroidvania aspects were still very simplistic - the world was broken up into several islands, most of which had extremely linear maps - the new pirate abilities were much more fun and easy to use than the old transformations, so it was still fun to backtrack through the islands to find hidden items. (The series is closer to a sidescrolling Zelda, now that I think about it, since there are the dungeons that are separate from the overworld and don\t require a revisit unless you happen to miss something.) At the time, I (among others) thought that they still needed to make the next step towards a proper Metroidvania and they\d truly have something.\n                     \n                     Then there was Half-Genie Hero. First off, it was weird that they began the Kickstarter for this game\n                     \n                      after\n                     \n                     Pirate\s Curse had been announced, but\n                     \n                      before\n                     \n                     it actually released. We had only played the original game and Risky\s Revenge at this point, and had the promise of Pirate\s Curse releasing within a year or two. Additionally, the as-yet-unreleased Pirate\s Curse had the best character art in the series (thanks to IntiCreates aiding with parts of the game) as well as the best pixel art, HGH went with more of a chibi-styled, smooth style. Still, more Shantae was more Shantae, and it felt like the series was finally getting its due (even if the fans had to pay for some of the development). Ultimately, though, the game was closer to a Mega Man X entry than the earlier games\ Metroidvania/sidescrolling Zelda style. There was no overworld with dungeons, but instead several independent platforming stages that you would select from a list. As with the MMX games, you could return to completed stages with new abilities to find more powerups. Unlike the MMX games, though, in which you get both permanent upgrades (helmet, boots, etc.) and special weapons you can easily swap between, Shantae has to stop and do a transformation dance in order to use her new abilities. It leads to a slower, less fun, platforming experience and I was ultimately disappointed in the game.\n                     \n                     Finally, this leads us to Seven Sirens. We finally got what we wanted, in a monkey\s paw sort of way. There\s a full, interconnected, Metroidvania map now! ...But there are also the Zelda-like dungeons that are independent of each other and the overworld. While some of these have been fun in earlier games, the dungeons I played in SS are very simple and straightforward. I\d rather have just the connected map with more interesting platforming and puzzles. Additionally, early on you get an ability that reveals secrets, ranging from gems (money) to hidden platforms. The unfortunate part is that you get a visual notification on every screen in which there is something hidden, which is basically almost every screen, requiring you to stop and use the ability to try and find whatever it is. Most of the time, it\s nothing special, and this power also uses mana (or whatever), so you need to fill it up after using it several times.\n                     \n                     All that to say that the series has come close to greatness, but never quite reaches it, and the best entry is now lost in the middle of a bunch of mediocre-at-best games.',N'2024-12-29'),
(1474, 6,N'I debate back and forth whether or not I like this or pirates curse more. I like the change to one single open Metroidvania world when compared to the separate segmented ones of the past. The way transformations work is probably the best in the series with how seamless and fluid they are, but the dances feel a bit lame. Theres so many different rooms where you can use them and most of the time theres nothing more than gems that you get out of them.\n                     \n                     I found the gameplay balancing to be a a bit out of wack as well. I played on the definitive mode that the game recommends and found the game much, much harder at the beginning. You are starved for healing items and resources, which made the beginning parts a lot more challenging than anything later. But by about 33% through the game I had more than enough money to keep myself capped on all of the healing items.\n                     \n                     The progression feels a bit too formulaic as well, with the game constantly switching between having you find x amount of mcguffins and then doing a dungeon and then repeating till the end. That said, I enjoyed the game overall. The world is fun to explore, the powers are interesting and the music is great.',N'2024-12-16'),

In terms of presentations this is easily the best in the saga, the overworld graphics and the portraits be looking pretty cute, and although the music may be the weakest in the saga, it has some catchy tunes. As for gameplay, they finally fixed the transformations problem, even if theyre still not as good as the pirate gear in Pirates Curse its a step in the right direction. The game is great and a lot of fun, but it has some problems. The bosses are pretty bad, most of them consisting of dodging a sequence of three attacks and then hitting them for a while, rinse and repeat, although a couple of them are admittedly fun. The animated sequences look pretty rough too, but its a noble concept that I hope to see expanded in later games. Finally, good god, trying to beat this game with 100% completion is a freaking chore, as most of the items you need are hidden or in a location that hasnt been relevant in a while, and there being no markers on the map to remember where they are is a missed opportunity. Either way, its a pretty good game, the second best in the series, so if you liked Pirates Curse but were not a fan of Half Genie Hero, Id say play this to see how you like it.',N'2025-05-27'),

(1490, 8,N'As the first RPG that introduced me to the genre, it holds a special nostalgic place in my heart.

(1490, 5,N'There are some movies and TV shows that I\m convinced only really hit if you watch them at a certain age. It is my firm belief that if you haven\t watched Star Trek, Mean Girls, or The Breakfast Club before the age of 18, you will never understand or enjoy these things (at least, I did not)*. Similarly, I think some games are appreciated more if they come at a certain time in your life.\n                     \n                     Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is one of those games. This game would have been really cool if I had played it when I was 10-12 (it was not out in the mid-00s, and there was no way the graphic violence would have gotten past my Mom\s one-woman censorship board). It would probably be pretty cool if I was in college and played it while listening to lectures or something. However, as a grown man, this game feels very basic and boring.\n                     \n                     First offender is the combat. The combat is in real time, and feels close to Dragon\s Dogma or Scarlet Nexus, if you are familiar with those games. The combat in Amalur has the twin drawbacks of being barebones and stiff. There is only one basic attack (no light/heavy attacks or parries), a dodge that feels awkward to use, a range attack that quickly runs out of ammo and seems quite pointless, and a set of spells that can be customized. The spells are kind of cool, but they,  can\t really be chained into combos,. There is also a Super Saiyan mode that can be built up by filling up your rage/devil triggers/whatever; instead of making you superpowered for a small amount of time (like DmC) or giving you access to a massive attack that can curbstomp multiple enemies at once (like Blades of Time), it gives you the change to attack one enemy with a super special attack that gives you extra EXP. Combat in this game has no depth and feels like a repetitive chore; the lack of a parry, a decent dodge, or any combos beyond your basic tap X sequence is keenly felt. The swift, exciting, and somewhat open-ended combat of Devil May Cry has spoiled me, I suppose.\n                     \n                     It is true that there are some combos that you can unlock in the game, but I didn\t find the ones that I unlocked useful. Additionally, you also have to use perk points to unlock them only for specific weapons. Realize that the hammer sucks and want to use a greatsword? Too bad, you\ve put all of your points into the hammer. It is true that you can respec later on, but this kind of game would have benefitted from a Skyrim-style system where you level up weapons ability based on using the weapon.\n                     \n                     The story is your usual high-fantasy bafflegarble; it\s not great, but I\m usually fairly lenient on bad stories as long as they aren\t shoved in your face by cinematic cutscenes. The dialogue choices tend to be pointless and apparently you can use persuasion skills to steamroll past everything. I highly dislike dialogue choices in games where they do not make a difference or make very little difference; developers and writers need to have confidence in the story that they are telling.\n                     \n                     The open world is a series of poorly-disguised corridors with the occasional boring dungeon. The game feels less open than an N64 Zelda, and even the map clearly shows the corridors. Thus, there\s no real exploration in the game; not that there is any real point to the exploration anyway. I found nothing about the enemy designs, world, or other art to be at all interesting. The semi-cartoony art style clashed with the occasional graphic violence of the game. Every NPC has a thousand dialogue keywords that you can choose from, and none of them are interesting.  The loot system was not engaging or addicting; there was no way to easily compare stats for new items vs equipped items, and given the fact that combat felt like a chore, I didn\t really feel excited to upgrade my gear. I am barely interested in smithing, crafting, alchemy etc. in most games, and in any case Skyrim did all of these better than Amalur.\n                     \n                     Everything about this game just felt like busywork. I could probably forgive one or more mediocre elements of this game if they combined to create an immersive and interesting whole, but Amalur just feels like Fantasy Game: The Game. Everything in the game feels very much like a video game element. I don\t know if this makes sense, but it describes the sense I felt while playing it. It was the opposite of Skyrim, a game that, while it contains clunky and repetitive elements, really feels like living in a fantasy world. Amalur feels like playing a fantasy game (quite appropriately, since it was originally intended to be an MMO) and nothing about it grabbed me. In my earlier years I may have been able to ignore its many flaws, but at this point in my life, with so much experience gaming and so many superior choices available, I can\t justify playing this game.',N'2024-08-10'),

Having beaten Killzone 2 last year and temporarily given up on Mercenary after having my save data corrupted unknowingly, and with a buddy of mine going through the Killzone series on the highest difficulty as well. I decided to give this game a spin, and I have some thoughts. First I’ll go with the plot.',N'2024-03-20'),
(1499, 6,N'Rating: 7/10 -  Good',N'2024-08-25'),
(1499, 1,N'My review for killzone 2 applies here but the story is way worse. the gameplay is way more fun but they sacrificed the world building they set up for the past two games and it is a major blow to the franchise.',N'2024-08-26'),
(1499, 7,N'Great game despite ruining the franchise',N'2024-03-12'),
(1499, 9,N'Too short, controls too janky, predictable story, audio bugs.',N'2024-03-20'),
(1500, 8,N'The earliest memory I have of this game was with me and my cousins going at it with hell in a cell matches for hours and hours\n                     \n                     Really miss those times WWE games were this fun',N'2024-06-04'),
(1500, 10,N'sabú',N'2024-08-08'),
(1500, 1,N'The game itself is okay, its kinda fun. The part that sucks about this game is how little voicelines for the announcers there are. The game always just repeats the same voicelines over and over and its so annoying.',N'2024-03-31'),
(1500, 3,N'After 2006 this series started spiraling downhill',N'2023-12-06'),
(1500, 3,N'but who could forget the time when rowdy roddy piper betrays you in the storyline?',N'2023-11-27'),
(1500, 6,N'This game ruined the series pretty much, has some novelty for the roster and gm mode/story mode but the gameplay is so much worse than earlier games',N'2025-01-23'),
(1501, 2,N'Its a reasonably solid rogue-lite RPG. The story, while nothing complex, is innovatively paced regardless of successful progression or not, without being penalised, keeping things moving and interesting despite your skill level. The pixel art is magnificent, and while some characters might feel a bit bland, they are still distinct and levelling newcomers is far from grindy, ensuring gameplay is varied without making it too tedious.',N'2025-03-29'),
(1501, 4,N'This is a neat game I played at a REALLY WEIRD time in my life that Im hopeful to never have to tell anyone about. It was good for then, but now its tied to that in a way I cant really untangle it from. I do recommend it as a co-op roguelike RPG thing, especially because the way it drip feeds story is a good first attempt at following the example Hades set. Making that a co-operative experience makes it more interesting as well, and honestly I think at this point the only time I ever want to engage with roguelikes again is co-operatively in weird times in my life.',N'2025-02-26'),
(1501, 8,N'Rating: 7.6/10 - Pretty Good',N'2024-07-04'),
(1501, 8,N'The gameplay gets a little repetitive after a while, but each character is pretty distinct and since it doesnt take that much time to level them up, its really easy to switch between them over the course of a playthrough.',N'2024-03-10'),
(1501, 5,N'Really solid arpg. Some of the characters felt superfluous, or maybe underdeveloped... eh, most* of them were fun.',N'2024-12-06'),
(1501, 3,N'Um bom jogo pra jogar coop, mesmo jogando no Difícil tem uma boa progressão, em nenhum momento chega a ser fácil mas tbm n tem nd que vc n consigo lidar pela dificuldade. Um narrador ao nível da história, incrível e tenebrosa.\n                     \n\n                      O jogo tem uma arte muito bela por sinal',N'2024-10-30'),

(1502, 7,N'it’s so weird this game even exists. like, ????? the godfather???  imagine if they did a game for like citizen kane or like jaws or smth.\n                     \n                     it’s good for what it is, as far as adaptations go.',N'2025-05-29'),
(1502, 2,N'Its very funny that this game has the same problems open world games still have (not enough to interact with and barely any reason to grind all the side stuff out), except its from 2006 and has great combat',N'2024-05-25'),
(1502, 6,N'A very good game based on a Very Classic movie. The character creation is all right, the vintage new york is pretty well made and the gameplay is good. A fun experience on PS2.',N'2024-04-07'),

(1503, 6,N'Truly a very large egg',N'2024-07-20'),
(1503, 3,N'Mechanics in this Katamari Sonic Adventure game are rough. 9/10 attempted jumps either get you killed or having only just the egg make it to the platform because your short ass is too tiny for this ride. Also never trust rails, Ive died way too many times because of RAILS.\n                     \n                     Fun game though, probably never gonna play it again.',N'2025-09-03'),
(1503, 2,N'this game was hard as balls to find and buy, i spent like a decade looking for it. was it worth the wait? i mean kinda? The game is oozing with sonic team charm all over the place, but sometimes the games mechanics will just screw you over, mostly in the fact that billy is kinda useless without an egg, so if theres a situation where your egg gets somewhere you cant go or you have to be seperated from your egg, then that makes you kinda just a sitting duck for a while. Other than that, its a totally servicable platformer with plenty of things to do and a BANGIN OST. Id say check it out, but I dont think its a must-play or anything. If you are the type of person that would even look at a game featuring a chicken boy rolling eggs around then I think youll find something to love here.',N'2024-01-08'),
(1503, 2,N'billy didn’t expect me to have hours of katamari tucked away so i was ready for his little rolly polly egg game',N'2024-04-15'),
(1503, 6,N'My father won this game for me and my sister before we even owned a GameCube. And to be honest, I barely remember if I liked it or not. I suppose it’s probably just average.',N'2025-05-16'),
(1503, 6,N'Trash, just fucking trash.',N'2025-01-25'),

(1504, 1,N'Favorite game in the series ive played so far?????????? EHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH IDK but it sure as shit is up there, i fucking love this game i love the stages i love the variety here and being able to do tags and solos is so fire\n                     \n                     I even got to try out characters i never rlly played much before like i think i finally understand how to play Lars, Nina, Jun and Bob\n                     \n                     and I love playing Jaycee a lot too\n                     \n                     Shame that this is like literally her only game shes in.. technically LMAO\n                     \n                     thats okay though bc Lei has never let me down anyways',N'2024-12-25'),
(1504, 1,N'Run it homie',N'2024-04-03'),
(1504, 4,N'As a game its great, as an experience, with the online mode and the different forms of BS this game had to offer at higher levels of play, it was frustrating',N'2025-10-11'),
(1505, 0,N'My favorite thing to do was go into sandbox and place 30 Gatling guns',N'2024-10-05'),
(1505, 5,N'I bought the deluxe version of this game as a kid and never received it. I hit wits end that day.',N'2025-06-30'),
(1505, 9,N'played in middle school\n                     \n                     it was fun i guess',N'2024-05-16'),

(1506, 4,N'el de arcade es mejor, lo pase después de varias noches de sexo desenfrenado con mi panita Gabo, comentario muy gordito pero tiene minijuegos que adaptan partes del manga que no pueden mostrarse como pelea y eso me gusto, osea usuarios de stand que no peleaban como tal etc etc',N'2025-07-01'),
(1506, 7,N'this game is very bizarre??',N'2025-11-16'),
(1506, 3,N'the super story mode in the playstation version has a lot of weird silly minigames and cutscenes. play it for the most unique adaptation of stardust crusaders',N'2024-04-22'),
(1506, 6,N'Capcom really make this game with passion. The graphics are superb and Capcom had their sprite work at the top. The gameplay is very good, some characters can be unbalanced though, but the music is phenomenal. The story mode is great! Explaining the entire plot from the manga, a negative point is the quick time events which are very unfair when they appear. Great game, super fun, worth to play it.',N'2025-06-17'),
(1506, 2,N'https://youtu.be/DJKY1lNJQ8Q',N'2025-01-21'),
(1507, 1,N'this one raises the bar for both video games and sci-fi for anyone who experiences it',N'2025-09-08'),
(1507, 8,N'Esse jogo não tem uma linha de diálogo sequer.',N'2025-07-13'),
(1507, 1,N'A favorite game of mine.  The feeling of being disconnected in a mostly lonely and alien atmosphere, all while attempting to fumble your way through survival with ideas and guesswork feels relatable.  The art style opens imagination with its shadowed beasts and imperfect shapes as you explore your surroundings, where the only clear goal is to keep moving.',N'2024-10-06'),
(1507, 10,N'A very beautiful looking game. That was basically the only reason this game peaked my interest. Been wanting to play this one for almost a decade. Honestly, its fine. Its another difficult side scroller with rotoscoped graphics. Very stunning but the gameplay is just... wow. That some shit.',N'2024-06-14'),
(1507, 5,N'Visually spectacular, but far too difficult for me.',N'2023-12-20'),
(1507, 6,N'Valiente Mierda',N'2024-10-11'),
(1508, 0,N'Very enjoyable game. The story adds onto the movies without ruining anything from them. The gameplay is also pretty cool and fun, the puzzles are challenging but not annoying.',N'2025-08-16'),
(1508, 7,N'i need to give this another try',N'2025-06-10'),
(1508, 5,N'When I was little I was obsessed with Back to the Future and then I found this game on my iPad. I played it all the time and I made my dad buy all the episodes. I didn’t even really know much in english so I was always asking my dad what this and that means lol. Poor dad. I don’t remember much of the episodes except for the first one so I can’t really give the game a rating. Anyways I really love this game still and I am very sad it is no longer available on my iPad :((',N'2025-11-05'),
(1508, 6,N'Probably the closest well ever get to BTTF 4 but honestly they pulled it off.',N'2024-08-02'),
(1508, 8,N'Für mich der inoffizielle vierte Teil der Reihe. Klar, die Puzzles dieses Point and Click Adventures von Telltale sind super einfach, aber ich bin hier wegen der Story und die wurde in meinen Augen gelungen weitergeführt. Ein Trumpf ist auch, dass Christopher Lloyd als Doc Brown zurückkehrt und die englische Stimme von Marty unfassbar nah an Michael J. Fox ist. Wer die Filme liebt, kann hier eigentlich kaum etwas falsch machen. Spannend, toll geschrieben, mit viel Humor und dem Herz am rechten Fleck. Ein Muss für alle, die sich einen vierten Teil wünschen, aber Angst haben, dass ein weiterer Film das Ansehen der Reihe zerstören könnte.',N'2024-07-31'),

(1509, 10,N'not my cup of tea',N'2024-02-07'),
(1509, 5,N'Compared to the previous two sonic kart racers from sumo digital, this game is a step back in almost every direction. I had very high expectations for this game, coming from the masterpiece that is sonic and all stars racing transformed, and while the only-sonic approach had me initially concerned, I realized that the sonic IP is definitely vast enough to have enough interesting locales and characters to base an entire kart racer off of. As long as the tracks were solid and the mechanics were fun, thats all this game needed to be a winner.',N'2024-04-07'),
(1509, 10,N'One of the funnest PS plus games ever.',N'2024-09-16'),
(1509, 3,N'it looks pretty ig',N'2024-09-17'),
(1509, 3,N'Feels great to play but the lack of budget kills all of its goodwill. Its fun having a game where the (mostly) full Sonic cast is interacting again, but theres no meat on this plots bone - even less so in the campaigns actual missions and pacing.',N'2024-01-30'),

(1511, 8,N'A thriving story with well-written companions, close-to-perfect D&D mechanics, Better combat system than Divinity 2: Original Sin. As for the graphics, the characters look very realistic, facial capture artists are really beautiful. Before you play the game I suggest that you should read Descent Into Avernus. My last words are, I CANT WAIT TO PLAY ACT 2-3.',N'2025-06-13'),

(1511, 1,N'Game can be fun but the story, character interactions, and the characters themselves all FUCKING SUCK. Its early access so I wont hate on glitches but god damn do the characters reek doodoo! Laezel is one dimension and lame, Shadowheart is fucking boring and again one dimensional, Gael is like someone wrote their own op ass DnD character into the game at level 1 with the excuse being they lost their power. Astarion is funny as fuck, but is also just one dimensional. If you wanna be good then dont have him in your party because he will not like anything you do. Will is the only party member that I even remotely like. He is at least a nice guy with an okay backstory. Game is also terribly optimized for storage.',N'2025-10-25'),

	(1, 2,N'The first playthrough of elden ring is one of the best eperiences gaming can offer you but after youve explored everything in the open world and youve experienced all of the surprises you lose motivation to go exploring on repeat playthroughs which takes a lot away from the replayability which is a very important thing for from games imo.',N'2025-08-28'),
(1, 3,N'a replay solidified my love for elden ring. so easily my favorite game of all time. actually beating malenia this time was also an amazing feeling. i just love being in this world man its the greatest of all time',N'2025-03-05'),

If you have a powerful enough pc I definitely recommend you play it on there, if you use keyboard, you’ll want to change the keybinds because the defaults are ass.',N'2024-10-11'),
(1, 10,N'Tied as my favorite souls game with Bloodborne, truly one Ill keep coming back too.',N'2025-05-12'),
(2, 9,N'convinced this is a roguelike for people who do not like the genre. The art is technically good but the aesthetic does very little for me, too clean or something. idk wish I liked it but I do not',N'2024-10-13'),
(2, 4,N'incredible art, a banger soundtrack a surprisingly charming storyline and a big red dog. hades has very smooth gameplay but after playing it for a while it just feels like youre doing the same 3 hit combo ove and over again, which dont get me wrong that combo feels great to do but once i becomes muscle memory you kinda go into autopilot. also i think the boons are cool but i would like to see them change the flow of combat a bit more, there are some cool ones like the grape boon that can change the way you play but most of them are just upgrades that dont really change the gameplay or strategy. other then those 2 small gripes the game is fantastic.',N'2025-03-19'),

(2, 6,N'Não sou muito de jogo indie, admito que joguei poucos, mas devo dizer que Hades foi um dos melhores jogos que joguei na vida, facilmente no top 15. Toda sua arte, dublagem, gameplay, carisma dos personagens, é tudo incrivel',N'2024-09-03'),
(2, 9,N'I cant shake the feeling that I am thoroughly bored playing Hades. Ive picked up Hades three times over the last few years, and three times Ive found myself putting down the controller after a handful of hours, especially after reaching the third stage, and I couldnt figure out why it wasnt working for me. After giving it a few good goes, Ive finally managed to pin down what it is that just doesnt click for me about Hades.',N'2024-07-09'),

(3, 3,N'A really good switch game, however didnt really grip me like mario odyssey',N'2025-02-04'),
(3, 9,N'i was very disappointed by the final boss fight, but the rest of the game is so good it makes me not want to even do the final boss fight anyway just so i can play more of the game. i do wish that there were more unique mechanics in combat besides just parrying and links flurry rush, but the world is really pretty and actually incentivizes exploring it. characters are great, story is great and makes you work for it, and theres tons of hidden secrets and details.',N'2025-03-08'),

Va más allá de un simple juego, es una experiencia que lamentablemente solo se puede vivir una vez en la vida y la recomiendo totalmente.',N'2024-07-06'),
(3, 1,N'em meio a tanto jogo de mundo aberto ruim saindo por aí na última década, acho que da pra entender porque breath of the wild chocou tanto as pessoas no ano em que ele lançou. E realmente eu acho que é o melhor mundo aberto que eu já joguei até hoje, explorar cada pedacinho desse mundo é TÃO GOSTOSO, parece que tudo aqui tá no mapa tem um propósito para estar lá, diferente dos mapas vazios da ubisoft por exemplo. Acho que o unico defeito é esses sistema chatinho de durabilidade das armas, ficar trocando de arma o tempo todo é tão chato, espero que no próximo não tenha.',N'2025-10-29'),

(5, 9,N'I\d give this game a 4 for each individual aspect (platforming, exploration, combat) but the integration and packaging of the content are so good, it\s slightly better that the sum of its parts. Most of the combat and traversal abilities feel useful, and many evoke that Super Metroid-y, gleeful feeling that you\ll finally be able to access that new area, grab that item, or beat that boss. The end-game challenges, reminiscent of Wiley\s fortress and boss rushes after Megaman has fully self-actualized, were the highlight. Boss rushes in particular were fun to dissect and master. I found uses for some charms I had written off as not my style to counter some of the unconventional boss mechanics. My only gripes:\n                     \n                     -The repeated backtracking. I get it - a fast-travel mechanic that\s too liberal can erase the environment, but this was excessive.\n                     \n                     -Some of the charms seemed worthless, even after strategizing for boss, combat, and platforming rushes.\n                     \n                     -In the name of decency and civility, make geo-sucking ability automatic.',N'2025-07-03'),

I feel basil could definitely use some more screentime, the guy rarely gets any in the real world section of the game.

(10, 2,N'NieR: Automata is an unforgettable game. Androids vs. Machines, all while trying to save humanity, and uncover the cold truth of this post-apocalyptic world. 2B and 9S share a common goal, but have differing views through the story. The combat is more fleshed out than its predecessor due to chips and pod mechanics. Characters change and face reality after meeting characters and concepts never seen before.',N'2024-02-25'),
(10, 3,N'This is my favorite game ever and the only game I cared enough about to get the platinum trophy in. I might be biased here but the game has a lot of things I loved going in like the post apocalyptic setting. The game isn’t perfect and while things like the 9s hacking and route b pushed a lot of people away I still thoroughly enjoyed it.

(11, 1,N'This game is great, and to many people this is probably one of the greatest JRPGs if not, overall game of all time. I see that 100%, but I personally have my nitpicks with it, such as:\n                     \n                     -The pacing of the game\n                     \n                     -The fact it only gets good 30-40 hours into the game\n                     \n                     -The fact that essential, strategic, and most importantly, fun mechanics are locked behind confidants such as switching your party mid-battle\n                     \n                     -The lack of freedom to do what you want\n                     \n                     -Similar to SMT IV/IV:A (and maybe other SMT/Persona games, idk) they sell DLC for super powerful personas. In SMTIV at least, these were entirely optional and you had to purchase them. In Persona 5 Royal, they included the DLC, which again, I could ignore if they are optional, but I cant. Unlike in pervious games, there are legitimate fusions using legitimate personas that allow you to straight-up just get these P2W personas naturally, which I absolute fathom and throws the balance of the game out the window.\n                     \n                     -And more importantly, the entirety of Kasumis character pre-third semester (I want to punch her)',N'2024-12-04'),

(11, 9,N'Played like 50 hrs, I guess finished half or two-thirds of it? Cannot say I didnt like Persona 5 at all but this sort of infantile fleur around the characters and situations got me at last. I played some SMT games and they seemed much more sophisticated and thoughtful (especially the 4th). However, I cannot say that Persona 5 is a bad game, although my experience with it was a bit rough. I had this state of waiting for something, like 5-10 hours more, and something incredible would happen for sure, characters pull off some weird moves and the real Persona (the one everyone is so hyped up about) would begin... Never happened. Might finish it sometime later tho, whenever vibes come back.',N'2024-03-17'),

The textures are muddy , the levels especially alabaster Icelands and cobalt coastlands feel janky and overly linear despite the game encouraging more mobile movement and freedom , and of course the lack of meaningful presentation through stiff character animations and lack of voice acting hurt this game alot.

(27, 9,N'hmmmmmmm. Kind of a divisive one here for me personally. While I liked the characters, the plot felt kind of lacking and the connections to the other games in the series that were so hyped up by nintendo in marketing really didnt add to much, if anything. You could have replaced the references to the previous games with original stuff and nothing substantial would be different. In that aspect, this game was really disappointing. The villains were also an absolute joke, with the Mobius guys being the most generically boring guys in history and N being immensely less cool the more you learn about him. In terms of the gameplay though, it was certainly fun. The class system makes combat very customizable and I feel its absolutely possible to sink your teeth really into managing your party to get the most out of all your options. I also did a lot of side content in this game, which is uncharacteristic of me as I beelined it through the first two games. Exploration of the worlds is always fun in xenoblade games, and this is no exception. Perhaps I am just getting tired of the series, but this definitely didnt hit as much as the first or even the second game to me. Still would suggest to anyone that enjoyed the first two games because the gameplay is still fun but like yeaaaahh...',N'2024-03-05'),

A year or two later, I would play through the whole game, and later the DLC, in co-op with a friend. We did this over Steam so there was a bit of lag, but I had a controller and a friend to help me through. I enjoyed the game a lot more, to the point where I was the one pushing us to do the DLC together, but it still didnt quite enamour me like Id wanted it to. My main complaint at the time was the design of some of the bosses. I felt that a lot of them relied on being able to pay attention to cues and bullets coming from multiple parts of the screen, often with them all acting completely independently. I have a huge amount of trouble processing all of that information, so oftentimes I found bosses just far too overwhelming. Not a design issue or anything, more of a personal one.',N'2025-02-15'),

(36, 1,N'Loved this a lot. I missed the sense of exploration from Dark Souls, but the core action mechanics and satisfying parries more than made up for it. Other than a basic whole number for your damage and health, there\s no worrying about RPG values here. It\s a true action game taking place within the open-world Metroid-ish Souls structure, backed up with\n                     \n                      some\n                     \n                     items and buffs and junk if you decide to use them. But the lack of gear is probably the best thing about this - no armour sets, no elemental stats, no sword that deals +5 damage but -2 stamina. Funnily enough, people say this is the hardest FromSoftware game, but after a while it felt much, much easier to me than Dark Souls\n                     \n                      because\n                     \n                     there was nothing in my way except my own skill, which I greatly prefer. No main bosses that required some stupid consumable item for me to defeat properly. I don\t like feeling as if I need to grind to make myself better, because then it\s this vague guessing game of numbers. There were a few points in Dark Souls where I felt robbed of a boss fight because I must have been over-levelled, or I said screw it, summoned an NPC once and then steam-rolled the boss. No hollow victories here in Sekiro - although admittedly, once you get that perfect parry timing down, sometimes victory comes so fast that it\n                     \n                      almost\n                     \n                     feels unsatisfying.

Still has a lot of baffling decisions sprinkled throughout, though, which isn\t new for a Fromsoft game but this game is far more rigid in terms of there being a correct way to approach encounters so it only magnifies these issues when they appear. Soulsborne games (and ESPECIALLY Elden Ring) usually have a billion different ways you can break the game over your knee if something is really giving you trouble, but most of the time in Sekiro if the game throws something at you that\s bad and sucks you have to actually engage with the thing that\s bad and sucks, and that\s bad and sucks.',N'2025-01-15'),

(45, 5,N'I remember not thinking too much about the original RE2. Dont get me wrong, its a great game, but with REmake, RE3 and Code Veronica it was for me the weakest in the classic style saga. Then came this game in 2019. Holy fuck. Not only was this the first RE game I played on launch, but it just blew me away with how polished it was. The police station feels more real than ever, with dark and immersive areas that make you feel trapped and scared. The graphics also contribute to this, being incredibly realistic yet stylized, even if spme faces look a bit weird. I complained about how in the original RE playing as both characters wasnt worth it because the story barely changed, but thats completely fixed here. Not only do each of them have compelling and really different stories, but they also have different accessible rooms, gameplay segments and even final bosses. Another recurring problem with this franchise is that the best area is always the first one, and although thats also the case here, both the sewers and the lab are really fun and memorable in their own way.

Cloud is an absolute black hole of charisma. Nobody is fun to play as except for Barrett, who has the most simple combat systems out of the 4 options.',N'2025-10-16'),

I did find it to be very difficult at points and it can be somewhat easy to get lost. Also a vital system for progression can be too cryptic, but rewarding once you crack it.

(63, 8,N'Tunic is a wonderful 2D Zelda-like that feels like a love letter to the genre. Between an extremely charming aesthetic, fun and interesting items, and being extremely packed with puzzles and mystery, it would be hard not to recommend this game to any fan of the genre. The inclusions of things like a made up language and the instruction booklet all work to great effect to simulate that feeling you had when you were a kid trying to play a game like Links Awakening. Discovery is always well rewarded and always feel earned by the player. I feel as though there are very few handouts in terms of progression through the game, so even just simply navigating the world feels meaningful and accomplishing. Level design is top notch in this game and I love all the secrets and hidden paths they provide using the games isometric view.

Amazing levels, dialogue, music, and graphics with a lot of interesting choices that change little things, but still is fun to enjoy. Calling your buddies to do certain abilities in combat is so fun and makes you feel like the leader of a team, and the enemies are cool as well with a lot of alien variety. I think the biggest issue is that it drags on a bit longer than expected with some filler, and you dont get all your powers until the second to last planet. Another small issue I had is your character itself isnt too interesting. The shooting from your guns feels pretty weak, and there isnt a lot of variety in your own movements or cool abilities like the ones your friends have.

The soundtrack is really good and I enjoyed the characters quite a bit, even if they could feel quite dimensional. You dont really get that many RPG elements so you cant really focus or build on specific aspects, but it reminds me of a more streamlined monster hunter when combating robots using only slings and arrows. I think the game definitely was missing a lot of aspects that are commonplace in the genre, but this was their first open-world game. There were frustrating moments, and a lot of the times enemies move too quickly even during slow-mo to let you take advantage of shooting weak points, and I think the melee combat is pretty terrible. A light and a heavy sweep, that is pretty much it. The platforming is really good but also got annoying to traverse sometimes, epseically with how many mountain areas there are.

Jyun pulls a knife on Kiryu and another man appears out of nowhere and also interferes. A police officer also shows up. The man with the big head is frustrated that he made a mistake, but this causes the couple to run off. The man then reveals to Kiryu that he is called Shinohara.

This game is a really cool time capsule of not only by playing into the iconic gameplay style of the time ( the Konami Ninja Turtle arcade games), but it perseveres most of the original voice actors, art style, referances and characters.

Generally speaking, I enjoy playing stealth games with a controller. Stealth, like racing games, is a genre that benefits greatly from analog sticks. At the heart of a great stealth game is nail-biting tension and suspense. Vulnerability is stressed through risk outweighing reward. On a keyboard, all of your inputs are static. Are you pressing up? Good, you\re moving up. Jolting an analog stick up can mean the difference between shuffling silently and bringing in nearby ears for inspection. Even in games where this choice tends to be an illusion, it heightens the already high stakes of weaving in and out of crowded spaces as little more than a specter in the night.

Half the time youll be running around an empty level looking for that one door that gives you a yellow keycard with nothing in it, and the music is more like butchered versions of famous metal songs. The guns are great and the enemy design is rich and unique, but I really felt like they werent used to their full capability.

(134, 0,N'This is a collection of a bunch of vignettes that all play with JRPG tropes in unique ways, and for the most part I found these stories really unique and entertaining. This feels like the predecessor to Chrono Trigger in many ways, so fans of that game will immediately see similarities. It’s mostly a very accessible game, but my one big fault is that the game lets you choose any of these chapters to start with. Certain chapters I enjoyed within the context of the rest of the game, but are particularly unconventional and could make for a very weak first impression. Aside from that tho, I honestly loved this. Combat is a big standout for me, each encounter was like a mini tactics battle with a really fun grid system. I had to thoughtfully consider how to dispatch enemies effectively, and while it’s far from a difficult game, each battle had me engaged. Presentation is gorgeous with the HD-2D Switch remake, it’s a total overhaul that still remains faithful to the original. While some chapters are definitely weaker than others, I thoroughly enjoyed the majority of my time with this game. And while I won’t spoil the final segments that come after you finish the seven main chapters, I found them to be so fun and satisfying that they elevate the entire experience. This definitely deserves to be considered a classic of the era right alongside FFVI and Chrono Trigger.',N'2025-07-29'),

(134, 1,N'Honestly, there just wasnt enough here to keep me engaged. Most of the chapters dont encourage exploration, the combat is lackluster with little to no skill involved, and the characters are underwhelming on the whole with very little emotional impact. The space episode was the best one that I got to, and even that had me rolling my eyes at some points. I expect more from RPGs, even remasters of old classics.

As most reviews for this game have said, its really great that failing a skill check does not necessarily mean youre now going through a worse version of the game (in some cases its even a more fun route). The politics and wordbuilding are also super deep and will really please those who enjoy those topics in their media.  I personally found myself more engrossed by the games study of the main character, who was as awful and destructive as he was likeable and relatable. I also found it incredible how the writers have managed to give him his own personality while also allowing a huge amount of his character to be determined by the player. Normally games tend to present one of these two archetypes for their main character, but this mixture of both helps a lot in giving the player a much deeper connection with the character while also allowing the character to serve the main themes of the story.\n                     \n                     On that note, the amount of choices they give you for customizing him are insane, and they really dont feel overwhelming despite there being multiple methods to change your character.

But I cant say this is a great game, since it has some design decisions that are a little shit. Every Rope and climbing section is bad, there were only 3 boss fights which was kinda dissapointing, the Path of Hades I will never like, there was only 2 magic spells you really needed Posidens Wrath and Army of Hades, since they do so much damage and are AOE attacks, Zues lightning and Medusa are situational IMO, and the game isnt as mechanically in depth as something like DMC, Bayonetta, or Ninja Gaiden.

O jogo resolve usar uma abordagem mais simples, com apenas uma arma e alguns tipos de munições que em suma maioria é utilizada de maneira pontual ao decorrer da jogatina. A gameplay simples e relativamente repetitiva não é um problema aqui, visto que o jogo possui um enredo rico em detalhes e que consegue desenvolver sua premissa com perfeição.

And the visual style? Oh my god. I adore how this game looks so much, I want every game to look like this. It is so, so full of charm and colour and personality. Give me a Mario game that looks like this, give me a Pokemon game that looks like this, give me a fuckin GTA game that looks like this!! Genuinely what I would love more than anything else in the world is for the Zelda series - after Tears Of The Kingdom to come back to this style for the next mainline game. Dont just keep this relegated to remakes if you do Oracle Of Seasons & Ages, give me a full-on, original, top-down open-world game with this visual style. Drop me in a place as beautiful and mysterious as Koholint, tell me very little and let me discover it all on my own.',N'2024-04-21'),
(190, 4,N'In this first game, the story and switching between present day (circa 2007) and the past set in the Crusade era Holy Land is such an intriguing premise and the authenticity of the world and character design can be admired. That isn’t to say the game is the worst thing ever, but it truly is soooooooo tedious and repetitive that it’s tough to recommend. The parkour system is very cool and has a lot of attention to detail put into the running and climbing animations. Scaling towers and doing Leaps of Faiths is so fun which somewhat makes up for the overabundance of sync points. There are many other menial side missions that, while not lacking in variety, are just copy and pasted everywhere and it gets tiring very quickly. Play it if you’re curious as some of the stealth is fun (and a little more low key compared to later entires in the series), but don’t be surprised if it gets dull very quickly.',N'2025-02-24'),
(190, 7,N'Sinceramente, eu não curti. Sei que é o primeiro jogo e que as mecânicas ainda eram um rascunho, mas, caramba, é torturante escalar, o combate não tem diversidade nenhuma e o protagonista, apesar de interessante, não tem quase nada de carisma, sempre falando em tom neutro e sem expressar emoção.\n                     \n                     Para um início, mesmo levando em conta as limitações, ainda é bem fraco. É só ver que Prince of Persia fez mecânicas muito mais agradáveis, e que este deveria ser uma evolução pelo menos das escaladas, mas não é o que acontece. Basicamente o jogo não tem stealth, e isso matou a graça de muitas missões, pois você basicamente chega no inimigo e esfaqueia, depois aperta o botão para disfarçar. Me vi muitas vezes frustrado por ter de fazer missões repetitivas de assassinato onde tinham 3 alvos e se eu falhasse, ficava mais difícil porque os corpos dos que eu matei ainda estavam lá e os guardas ficavam em alerta, dificultando conseguir assassinar o alvo sem falhar, e as vezes os npcs (os loucos), simplesmente me empurravam, eu esbarrava em um guardsne falhava a missão.

I then played it again more recently, a couple of years ago to re-experience it and I love it. Ezio is the golden child of the series but Altair truly embodies the assassin in my mind infinitely better. Cold, calculating while still maintaining his humanity and code. I loved the city, running around and exploring while fighting enemies, but you definitely felt like there couldve been more tools to use in the game. I also really liked the Desmond sections, they had juuuussst enough mystery to them without being overwhelming.

Some thoughts:\n                     \n                     - the world look fun and visually appealing but the dungeons were painfully bland.\n                     \n                     - I liked the artstyle for character portraits and backgrounds and the demons look good in battles but i do not like the character designs.\n                     \n                     - Happy to see some of the demons they included in the game, if a bit limited. It was odd seeing some demons show up at much higher level than usual but that doesn\t affect the experience of the game at all\n                     \n                     - The boss fights were fun. I played on Normal and I can imagine them being pretty challenging in other difficulties. The way they were structured made it really feel like you were fighting Devil Summoners. The challenge quests in the Soul Matrix were a highlight.\n                     \n                     - Honestly the story isn\t that bad. It has some questionable writing moments and you need to really convince yourself that Soul Hack-ing makes sense but if you get past that, it\s enjoyable. Forget everything you know about SMT: Soul Hackers though\n                     \n                     - My biggest gripe with it, the gameplay. It\s a fun loop, it didn\t outstay its welcome, but it\s not for me. I felt the same after playing TMS.

It must be due to the prevailing notion that video games have an arbitrary expiration date. C’mon, fess up. I’m not saying everyone born after the early 90s shares these predilections, but there seems to be a widespread viewpoint among younger gamers that vilifies games that predate their own conception, especially those of the early pixelated 2D period released before the late 1990s.

The A-type is your classic endless game of tetris, and the B-type involves clearing a certain amount of garbage blocks.

Moving blocks left to right is very slow and it feels like the blocks rotate in a way where I keep accidentally misplacing them. No hard drops either. I respect the people that play this competitively for learning how to master the controls, because I sure as hell had a hard time. Getting the ending of the game by clearing a level 9 speed 5 height B game is a total crap shoot due to the RNG of what blocks you get and the arrangement of the garbage blocks, so just stick to the A-game.

Yume Nikki does not deserve to be lumped in with the contemporaries. Kikiyama, the developer, managed to extract clever narrative meaning within the bounds of RPG Makers limited toolset in a way that left me genuinely floored.

(243, 1,N'Max Payne is such a good game with some crippling problems that really date it. The voice acting is top tier, and James McCaffrey is the biggest reason for this success and is one of the best voice actors ever. The gameplay is unqiue and so satisfying, diving through the air as the world explodes around you and bullets whiz past you. The depiction of New York as this grim, snowy, crime-ridden land fits so well with the place and the cheesiness makes this so good. But I played this on the PC port, and the games crippling issues with the difficulty slider got annoying really quick. Walking through a door and getting insta-headshot three times and then the fourth time doing the same thing and not having it happen got annoying, and supposedly there is a major bug that makes it so the difficulty slider, which is tied to the only difficulty you can play at the start, is broken and doesnt properly balance the game. As well, some aspects feel a little too gamey in this serious tale, with a few levels sticking out like a sore thumb (the underground level). I feel enemy variety wasnt really a thing, just the same enemy that got stronger and stronger. But overall, this is a very good game with aspects that havent ever really been replicated as well, which is a shame. We need more top-tier, slow-mo shooters.',N'2025-04-27'),

Plus, smash games before this were unique enough from one another that theres enough reason to keep all the previous games around, whereas for this game, now that ultimates out, who the hell is still trying to play this? The game is solid, but like Im still burnt out on this series and I have this game (and myself) to blame.',N'2025-04-19'),

(254, 6,N'To many this is the best game out of the entire Kingodm Hearts series, and to be fair theres a lot going for this game. As with many Square Enix games, they always deliver when it comes to music & overall aesthetics, especially when compared to KH1 & other Final Fantasy titles. The gameplay is greatly improved upon over Kingdom Hearts 1 in almost every regard: camera, movement, combat, platforming; everything that was good is better and everything that was bad is pretty much fixed. With that being said, this is where the story begins to take a nosedive in every direction. I personally skip all the cutscenses just to enjoy gameplay, which while great is very slow to pickup in the beginning due to the Roxas portion of the game. Without skipping cutscenes, its going to take a long time for the gameplay to come together into something really enjoyable.',N'2024-07-03'),
(254, 9,N'In my review of KH1 I remarked on how if I played these games as a kid they would have totally been my absolute favorites, mostly due to how the game had a sort of magical sense to it seeing as it was a Disney title. This game felt like it had a better fusion of both the whimsical magic that makes Disney titles shine as well as the more edgy anime-ass vibes that Square Enix was known for. Combined, those two elements make for a game that I feel if I had played as a kid, it would have changed things the same way Sonic Adventure 2 did for me. That right there is a powerful energy that I can only really say belongs to these two games and these two games alone. Unfortunately, I played this a little too late for it to have that kind of impact on me personally, but I absolutely recognize that power when I see it. The game pretty much improves upon the first in every way, with better locales, fancier and flashier gameplay, a more intricate plot, the whole nine yards. My only major gripe that I have with it is I think the second half could have been streamlined a bit better, and they could have made both acts for each world happen in a row rather than having you go through every world twice. Outside of that, this is a particularly special game. Which is certainly something I never thought Id say about a mfin game where a bunch of edgy cloaked dudes and mickey mouse share the same screen space.',N'2024-12-08'),

(255, 0,N'I remember back when this was a concept video, and was super intrigued by the gameplay mechanics. I\m glad that the game actually found a final version, and wasn\t just a concept with nothing done with it! As for the actual game itself, it was neat. I liked how they focused a lot on perspective based puzzles not only with the main gimmick of resizing objects based on perspective, but also with things like lighting and making 2D objects 3D, and resizing yourself to solve puzzles. However, there definitely were a lot of points where you are just walking through hallways, which felt like padding. It seems like while the game concept was really cool, there really wasn\t a lot you could properly do to put those cool mechanics into practice to make the game the next portal like everyone thought it would be when it was shown off. That being said, Portal is a really high bar, so not reaching that expectation does not a bad game make, since this game is still definitely worth playing IMO. The story focusing on having different perspectives was also neat and tied into the game mechanics, which was cool. All in all, it didn\t disappoint and I would recommend giving it a play!',N'2025-09-27'),
(255, 3,N'Up there with the Portal Series as one of the best puzzle games for me. I\m not one of the best or brightest and so having puzzles centered around one thing like portals or in this case, perspective, means that it\s not too difficult to figure out what you may want to do. Each puzzle is really cool obviously, the use of perspective to fiddle with objects is trippy and fun to just mess with. My personal favorite part of the game was the level design and the way it made you feel like you were spiraling ever deeper in a dream. From the endlessly carpeted halls of a hotel to spooky dimly lit backrooms I was on the edge of my seat on this ride. At the very climax of the game, when you have been spiraling ever deeper trapped in this dream, the entire thing is kind of thrown away. While the ending still works (avoiding too much for spoilers) it was a bit of a punch in the gut to go from OH MY GOD IM DYING to its all good its the end :).

(257, 1,N'The Persona series, along with its parent series Shin Megami Tensai, have generally been consistent with their themes throughout the years. The collective unconscious, the masks that people wear to conceal their true selves, and references to ancient Greek and Japanese mythology are all motifs that are usually present in SMT and Persona games. This has led to a consistently murky tone throughout the series, in the undertones when not overtly. While the darkest game in the series is up for debate, theres no debating which is the brightest: Persona 4. Released just 2 years after the decidedly grim Persona 3, and on the same engine, P4 delivers an overall joyful and optimistic tone that helped it stand out not only from its predecessor, but from previous Persona and SMT games as well. This may seem counter-intuitive, as the focus of the story is on finding a murder suspect who kills 2 people within hours of the games beginning. Yet its the moment-to-moment dialogue, the soundtrack, even the color palette (the yellow theme provides an overall sunny disposition) that makes Persona 4 not only a joyful experience, but a joy to experience.',N'2024-03-29'),

None of the characters were very interesting, but my least favorite was easily the protagonist, because on top of the obviously bad idea of making him be part of a fictional Native American tribe, Delsin Rowe was also just annoying, as his constant quips and one-liners consistently got on my nerves.',N'2024-10-27'),

As your character can steal elemental powers from other people, theres a lot of different abilities you can use and can switch from element to element on the fly so thats cool.

The story choices, the ending, some of the decisions and such. But playing it now, all these years later with all the DLC I think it is amazing. I loved the combat, I loved seeing my cast of friends and all my actions add up, I loved how they expanded upon the reapers. And the Citadel DLC was... Wow. After binging 150-200 hours in Mass Effect 1 and 2 plus more of Mass Effect 3, playing this DLC was special. Being with all the companions I had, finally relaxed and seeing them happily talk to each other, remembering those that were lost... Thats what I think about when I hear the term Mass Effect. The companions. Best ones out there. And I didnt love the ending, but I was happy with how it wrapped up and I think that it was a good way to complete the series because it seems like they either wrote themselves in a corner, or they mightve had another idea planned that got changed for whatever reason.',N'2024-12-16'),

(304, 3,N'Dmc Devil may cry é um jogo bem sólido, com uma das melhores gameplays da série, e as melhores e mais divertidas seções de plataforma. A gameplay é muito boa, com muitos combos fluidos e variedade da armas , como parte fundamental dessa estrutura a troca rápida de armas durante um combo. Porém mesmo sendo um game muito gostoso de jogar , os inimigos não acompanham essa fluidez toda e acabam sendo na esmagadora maioria do jogo apenas sacos de pancadas de combos, o que abaixa e muito a dificuldade do game, o que pode desagradar alguns ( incluindo eu). No geral embora conte com um ou outro inimigo interessante, no geral os inimigos não tem metade do carisma da série principal, o que tbm se reflete um pouco nos poucos chefes do game, na qual  dois em especial são bem criativos e legais , porém os outros não tem o mesmo tempero que a série clássica. Quanto a história aoesar de um Reboot, dá pra perceber o cuidado de contar uma história de início mais consistente e uniforme, diferente da série principal que é uma bagunça tremenda na questão do enredo e cronologia. A história do jogo funciona passando um ar demoníaco mais sujo e pé no chão do que o padrão anime da série original, o que nesse jogo caiu muito bem. Porém acredito que o maior responsável pelo rage que esse jogo sofreu seja seu protagonista Dante, que não tem 20% do carisma do protagonista original, e somada a péssima estratégia de marketing usada na promoção desse jogo na época, apenas reforçaram a aversão ao personagem, o que infelizmente se refletiu na repercussão do game.

I\d also argue that while most of the key characters looked good at launch, most of the npcs looked pretty rough The sheer amount of mods I have running on this game to make it look good on modern monitors would make most players heads spin. Don\t get me wrong, it\s not like Jade Empire, where it\s totally unplayable without fixes but it\s not exactly the best impression if you just play vanilla. We\ll probably get a remaster someday.

(306, 10,N'Squaresoft was absolutely dominating the RPG genre at the turn of the millennium; Final Fantasy, Chrono Cross, and Legend of Mana are just a few examples of the types of games which were experiencing their heyday in the late 5th generation. They dabbled in the action RPG subgenre before, but with the release of Vagrant Story in 2000, the action aspect was amplified, and the RPG aspect was significantly toned down. Players expecting a similar experience to previously mentioned games would be in for a big surprise, as this title lacked all the tropes you would expect in a typical RPG; no levels, no parties, no item shops, no grinding. Vagrant Story\s main appeal, at the time and currently, is its diversion from the norm of what RPGs were expected to be.

The level themes are all very unique, the soundtrack is great, and the gameplay is the boost formula we all know and love, so why is it that this game didnt stick with me the way most other sonic games didnt? I guess while the gameplay is cool, most of the level design revolves around controlling sonic in a 2D space, and Ive always been more of a fan of the 3D setpieces sonic runs around instead of the 2D segments in modern sonic levels.

Matches, distinctive survival horror, and potato aim (due to Sebastian\s inherent human error, which some will complain about because if a game isn\t 100% efficient to the player\s skill it must be bad this is explicitly directed to people like CarcinogenSDA who have expressed horrid opinions about this game) are abandoned for half-baked exploration and an expanded story whose formulaic foundations can only be saved by the series\ great environmental and creature designs, particularly Camera Obscura. This is still a highly entertaining experience throughout to say the least. Enemies are less janky to deal with, and the gunplay/stealth, while easier, are more fun in general. Nevertheless, The Evil Within will remain one of survival horror\s defining successes in a decade where no one else was really making them until Capcom\s faithful return in 2017.

In SMTIV at least, these were entirely optional and you had to purchase them. In Persona 5 Royal, they included the DLC, which again, I could ignore if they are optional, but I cant.

You could have replaced the references to the previous games with original stuff and nothing substantial would be different. In that aspect, this game was really disappointing. The villains were also an absolute joke, with the Mobius guys being the most generically boring guys in history and N being immensely less cool the more you learn about him. In terms of the gameplay though, it was certainly fun. The class system makes combat very customizable and I feel its absolutely possible to sink your teeth really into managing your party to get the most out of all your options. I also did a lot of side content in this game, which is uncharacteristic of me as I beelined it through the first two games. Exploration of the worlds is always fun in xenoblade games, and this is no exception. Perhaps I am just getting tired of the series, but this definitely didnt hit as much as the first or even the second game to me.

(361, 7,N'Ive had a bit of a troubled history with Cuphead. Before now Ive tried it on two different occasions, both with varying results. My first attempt ended pretty swiftly since I didnt have a controller and the keyboard controls are... really bad! The game didnt quite jive with me at that point, but my main problem at that point was the hell that is cuphead with keyboard controls. A year or two later, I would play through the whole game, and later the DLC, in co-op with a friend. We did this over Steam so there was a bit of lag, but I had a controller and a friend to help me through. I enjoyed the game a lot more, to the point where I was the one pushing us to do the DLC together, but it still didnt quite enamour me like Id wanted it to. My main complaint at the time was the design of some of the bosses. I felt that a lot of them relied on being able to pay attention to cues and bullets coming from multiple parts of the screen, often with them all acting completely independently. I have a huge amount of trouble processing all of that information, so oftentimes I found bosses just far too overwhelming. Not a design issue or anything, more of a personal one.',N'2024-02-06'),

(362, 1,N'Loved this a lot. I missed the sense of exploration from Dark Souls, but the core action mechanics and satisfying parries more than made up for it. Other than a basic whole number for your damage and health, there\s no worrying about RPG values here. It\s a true action game taking place within the open-world Metroid-ish Souls structure, backed up with\n                     \n                      some\n                     \n                     items and buffs and junk if you decide to use them. But the lack of gear is probably the best thing about this - no armour sets, no elemental stats, no sword that deals +5 damage but -2 stamina. Funnily enough, people say this is the hardest FromSoftware game, but after a while it felt much, much easier to me than Dark Souls\n                     \n                      because\n                     \n                     there was nothing in my way except my own skill, which I greatly prefer. No main bosses that required some stupid consumable item for me to defeat properly. I don\t like feeling as if I need to grind to make myself better, because then it\s this vague guessing game of numbers. There were a few points in Dark Souls where I felt robbed of a boss fight because I must have been over-levelled, or I said screw it, summoned an NPC once and then steam-rolled the boss. No hollow victories here in Sekiro - although admittedly, once you get that perfect parry timing down, sometimes victory comes so fast that it\n                     \n                      almost\n                     \n                     feels unsatisfying.

(362, 4,N'It only took me three playthroughs but I finally like this game! Still has a lot of baffling decisions sprinkled throughout, though, which isn\t new for a Fromsoft game but this game is far more rigid in terms of there being a correct way to approach encounters so it only magnifies these issues when they appear. Soulsborne games (and ESPECIALLY Elden Ring) usually have a billion different ways you can break the game over your knee if something is really giving you trouble, but most of the time in Sekiro if the game throws something at you that\s bad and sucks you have to actually engage with the thing that\s bad and sucks, and that\s bad and sucks.',N'2024-07-17'),

(371, 2,N'I remember not thinking too much about the original RE2. Dont get me wrong, its a great game, but with REmake, RE3 and Code Veronica it was for me the weakest in the classic style saga. Then came this game in 2019. Holy fuck. Not only was this the first RE game I played on launch, but it just blew me away with how polished it was. The police station feels more real than ever, with dark and immersive areas that make you feel trapped and scared. The graphics also contribute to this, being incredibly realistic yet stylized, even if spme faces look a bit weird. I complained about how in the original RE playing as both characters wasnt worth it because the story barely changed, but thats completely fixed here. Not only do each of them have compelling and really different stories, but they also have different accessible rooms, gameplay segments and even final bosses. Another recurring problem with this franchise is that the best area is always the first one, and although thats also the case here, both the sewers and the lab are really fun and memorable in their own way.

The game has an arcade/Dreamcast gameplay loop, where it\s incredibly addicting to play level after level, memorizing the way forward to get the best times. If this game was just a level select screen, I think it might be my favorite game of the year thus far, but sadly this game has one major flaw, and that is the plot. It\s an incredibly stereotypical anime amnesia plot full of boring psychopathic enemies, cringy sexual innuendos, and awful voice acting. Yes, I know the guy who played Spike is in it, but this is not his best performance. I ended up muting the voice audio, and that helped quite a bit, but the plot still has nothing to offer.

The era of Ninja Turtles that most intrest me like im sure many, is the 80s cartoon era. This game is a really cool time capsule of not only by playing into the iconic gameplay style of the time ( the Konami Ninja Turtle arcade games), but it perseveres most of the original voice actors, art style, referances and characters. The game almost can feel like a crash course to somebody like me who doesnt know much about the series, which I really apreciate. There are some really good tracks in this, most of which were composed by the Sonic Mania composer. The physical edition even came with a Pizza Hut coupon for a free personal pan pizza, which is incredible (I ate pizza pretty much every time I played this game).

Generally speaking, I enjoy playing stealth games with a controller. Stealth, like racing games, is a genre that benefits greatly from analog sticks. At the heart of a great stealth game is nail-biting tension and suspense. Vulnerability is stressed through risk outweighing reward. On a keyboard, all of your inputs are static. Are you pressing up? Good, you\re moving up. Jolting an analog stick up can mean the difference between shuffling silently and bringing in nearby ears for inspection. Even in games where this choice tends to be an illusion, it heightens the already high stakes of weaving in and out of crowded spaces as little more than a specter in the night.

Certain chapters I enjoyed within the context of the rest of the game, but are particularly unconventional and could make for a very weak first impression. Aside from that tho, I honestly loved this. Combat is a big standout for me, each encounter was like a mini tactics battle with a really fun grid system. I had to thoughtfully consider how to dispatch enemies effectively, and while it’s far from a difficult game, each battle had me engaged. Presentation is gorgeous with the HD-2D Switch remake, it’s a total overhaul that still remains faithful to the original.

(429, 0,N'I really enjoyed this one. The story is super interesting, most characters are multi-layered and more complex than they initially seem, and how this game handles skills and thoughts is genius. As most reviews for this game have said, its really great that failing a skill check does not necessarily mean youre now going through a worse version of the game (in some cases its even a more fun route). The politics and wordbuilding are also super deep and will really please those who enjoy those topics in their media.  I personally found myself more engrossed by the games study of the main character, who was as awful and destructive as he was likeable and relatable. I also found it incredible how the writers have managed to give him his own personality while also allowing a huge amount of his character to be determined by the player. Normally games tend to present one of these two archetypes for their main character, but this mixture of both helps a lot in giving the player a much deeper connection with the character while also allowing the character to serve the main themes of the story.\n                     \n                     On that note, the amount of choices they give you for customizing him are insane, and they really dont feel overwhelming despite there being multiple methods to change your character.

The fighting system works and seems interesting at the beginning but by the end, it is barely enjoyable, spamming skills and rolling around from hundreds of enemies to... what? To get a new pair of the same-looking rounded glasses (no no no we still do not get that this is a Harry-Potter-inspired game)? 33 copies of the same old black cloak? Same thing with exploring -- theres simply no reason to explore the giant territory of non-interesting copy-paste bandit and goblin camps, a stupid forest that spread across the Highlands that looks exactly the same at any point of your destination (apart from the small part to the south) to get a bunch of decorative pieces.

Now onto the negatives, the game is not well optimized for the switch at all. We have so many problmes both old and new as well as it overheating my switch recently. The Gym Test and raiding Team Bases are boring and monotonous. The Titan bosses are a joke with them being piss easy. I like the idea of an open world pokemon game but this game isnt that at all. There is an order to do things and even then you have to defeat team star bases to traverse further in the region. The Final battle is scrippted and I dont want that in a Pokemon game.

Genuinely what I would love more than anything else in the world is for the Zelda series - after Tears Of The Kingdom to come back to this style for the next mainline game. Dont just keep this relegated to remakes if you do Oracle Of Seasons & Ages, give me a full-on, original, top-down open-world game with this visual style.

(457, 10,N'In this first game, the story and switching between present day (circa 2007) and the past set in the Crusade era Holy Land is such an intriguing premise and the authenticity of the world and character design can be admired. That isn’t to say the game is the worst thing ever, but it truly is soooooooo tedious and repetitive that it’s tough to recommend. The parkour system is very cool and has a lot of attention to detail put into the running and climbing animations. Scaling towers and doing Leaps of Faiths is so fun which somewhat makes up for the overabundance of sync points. There are many other menial side missions that, while not lacking in variety, are just copy and pasted everywhere and it gets tiring very quickly. Play it if you’re curious as some of the stealth is fun (and a little more low key compared to later entires in the series), but don’t be surprised if it gets dull very quickly.',N'2024-02-26'),
(457, 2,N'Sinceramente, eu não curti. Sei que é o primeiro jogo e que as mecânicas ainda eram um rascunho, mas, caramba, é torturante escalar, o combate não tem diversidade nenhuma e o protagonista, apesar de interessante, não tem quase nada de carisma, sempre falando em tom neutro e sem expressar emoção.\n                     \n                     Para um início, mesmo levando em conta as limitações, ainda é bem fraco. É só ver que Prince of Persia fez mecânicas muito mais agradáveis, e que este deveria ser uma evolução pelo menos das escaladas, mas não é o que acontece. Basicamente o jogo não tem stealth, e isso matou a graça de muitas missões, pois você basicamente chega no inimigo e esfaqueia, depois aperta o botão para disfarçar. Me vi muitas vezes frustrado por ter de fazer missões repetitivas de assassinato onde tinham 3 alvos e se eu falhasse, ficava mais difícil porque os corpos dos que eu matei ainda estavam lá e os guardas ficavam em alerta, dificultando conseguir assassinar o alvo sem falhar, e as vezes os npcs (os loucos), simplesmente me empurravam, eu esbarrava em um guardsne falhava a missão.

I then played it again more recently, a couple of years ago to re-experience it and I love it. Ezio is the golden child of the series but Altair truly embodies the assassin in my mind infinitely better. Cold, calculating while still maintaining his humanity and code. I loved the city, running around and exploring while fighting enemies, but you definitely felt like there couldve been more tools to use in the game. I also really liked the Desmond sections, they had juuuussst enough mystery to them without being overwhelming.

There’s lots of neat level designs and environments that caught me off guard, and were very enjoyable to play.

Selene is such a cool, determined character and I really loved the combat and effects. This was really the first next-gen game I played on the PS5 and it didnt disappoint. My main issue is that it is a roguelike, but it doesnt have any replabilitiy. I really didnt feel any reason to go back through this game and only came back after my initial playthrough for the DLC which definitely helps me want to replay through it. But you cant really control or change builds to have drastically different play styles. Youre still dodging and shooting with an active reload for the most part and that is it, with the variety coming from the enemies and biomes. I hope we get a sequel that turns it into a true roguelike, letting me focus on melee or dashing or tanking shots or being a glass cannon or something to add more variety that this game needed.',N'2025-03-19'),

Some thoughts:\n                     \n                     - the world look fun and visually appealing but the dungeons were painfully bland.\n                     \n                     - I liked the artstyle for character portraits and backgrounds and the demons look good in battles but i do not like the character designs.\n                     \n                     - Happy to see some of the demons they included in the game, if a bit limited.

The challenge quests in the Soul Matrix were a highlight.\n                     \n                     - Honestly the story isn\t that bad. It has some questionable writing moments and you need to really convince yourself that Soul Hack-ing makes sense but if you get past that, it\s enjoyable. Forget everything you know about SMT: Soul Hackers though\n                     \n                     - My biggest gripe with it, the gameplay.

It must be due to the prevailing notion that video games have an arbitrary expiration date. C’mon, fess up. I’m not saying everyone born after the early 90s shares these predilections, but there seems to be a widespread viewpoint among younger gamers that vilifies games that predate their own conception, especially those of the early pixelated 2D period released before the late 1990s.

Its not necessary and this game can honestly be played solo but youre missing out on a lot if youre not interacting with anybody in an MMO.

Moving blocks left to right is very slow and it feels like the blocks rotate in a way where I keep accidentally misplacing them. No hard drops either. I respect the people that play this competitively for learning how to master the controls, because I sure as hell had a hard time. Getting the ending of the game by clearing a level 9 speed 5 height B game is a total crap shoot due to the RNG of what blocks you get and the arrangement of the garbage blocks, so just stick to the A-game.

The voice acting is top tier, and James McCaffrey is the biggest reason for this success and is one of the best voice actors ever. The gameplay is unqiue and so satisfying, diving through the air as the world explodes around you and bullets whiz past you. The depiction of New York as this grim, snowy, crime-ridden land fits so well with the place and the cheesiness makes this so good. But I played this on the PC port, and the games crippling issues with the difficulty slider got annoying really quick. Walking through a door and getting insta-headshot three times and then the fourth time doing the same thing and not having it happen got annoying, and supposedly there is a major bug that makes it so the difficulty slider, which is tied to the only difficulty you can play at the start, is broken and doesnt properly balance the game. As well, some aspects feel a little too gamey in this serious tale, with a few levels sticking out like a sore thumb (the underground level). I feel enemy variety wasnt really a thing, just the same enemy that got stronger and stronger. But overall, this is a very good game with aspects that havent ever really been replicated as well, which is a shame. We need more top-tier, slow-mo shooters.',N'2024-01-14'),

(541, 9,N'To many this is the best game out of the entire Kingodm Hearts series, and to be fair theres a lot going for this game. As with many Square Enix games, they always deliver when it comes to music & overall aesthetics, especially when compared to KH1 & other Final Fantasy titles. The gameplay is greatly improved upon over Kingdom Hearts 1 in almost every regard: camera, movement, combat, platforming; everything that was good is better and everything that was bad is pretty much fixed. With that being said, this is where the story begins to take a nosedive in every direction. I personally skip all the cutscenses just to enjoy gameplay, which while great is very slow to pickup in the beginning due to the Roxas portion of the game. Without skipping cutscenes, its going to take a long time for the gameplay to come together into something really enjoyable.',N'2025-04-13'),
(541, 1,N'In my review of KH1 I remarked on how if I played these games as a kid they would have totally been my absolute favorites, mostly due to how the game had a sort of magical sense to it seeing as it was a Disney title. This game felt like it had a better fusion of both the whimsical magic that makes Disney titles shine as well as the more edgy anime-ass vibes that Square Enix was known for. Combined, those two elements make for a game that I feel if I had played as a kid, it would have changed things the same way Sonic Adventure 2 did for me. That right there is a powerful energy that I can only really say belongs to these two games and these two games alone. Unfortunately, I played this a little too late for it to have that kind of impact on me personally, but I absolutely recognize that power when I see it. The game pretty much improves upon the first in every way, with better locales, fancier and flashier gameplay, a more intricate plot, the whole nine yards. My only major gripe that I have with it is I think the second half could have been streamlined a bit better, and they could have made both acts for each world happen in a row rather than having you go through every world twice. Outside of that, this is a particularly special game. Which is certainly something I never thought Id say about a mfin game where a bunch of edgy cloaked dudes and mickey mouse share the same screen space.',N'2025-04-02'),

(542, 10,N'I remember back when this was a concept video, and was super intrigued by the gameplay mechanics. I\m glad that the game actually found a final version, and wasn\t just a concept with nothing done with it! As for the actual game itself, it was neat. I liked how they focused a lot on perspective based puzzles not only with the main gimmick of resizing objects based on perspective, but also with things like lighting and making 2D objects 3D, and resizing yourself to solve puzzles. However, there definitely were a lot of points where you are just walking through hallways, which felt like padding. It seems like while the game concept was really cool, there really wasn\t a lot you could properly do to put those cool mechanics into practice to make the game the next portal like everyone thought it would be when it was shown off. That being said, Portal is a really high bar, so not reaching that expectation does not a bad game make, since this game is still definitely worth playing IMO. The story focusing on having different perspectives was also neat and tied into the game mechanics, which was cool. All in all, it didn\t disappoint and I would recommend giving it a play!',N'2025-06-27'),
(542, 9,N'Up there with the Portal Series as one of the best puzzle games for me. I\m not one of the best or brightest and so having puzzles centered around one thing like portals or in this case, perspective, means that it\s not too difficult to figure out what you may want to do. Each puzzle is really cool obviously, the use of perspective to fiddle with objects is trippy and fun to just mess with. My personal favorite part of the game was the level design and the way it made you feel like you were spiraling ever deeper in a dream. From the endlessly carpeted halls of a hotel to spooky dimly lit backrooms I was on the edge of my seat on this ride. At the very climax of the game, when you have been spiraling ever deeper trapped in this dream, the entire thing is kind of thrown away. While the ending still works (avoiding too much for spoilers) it was a bit of a punch in the gut to go from OH MY GOD IM DYING to its all good its the end :).

The collective unconscious, the masks that people wear to conceal their true selves, and references to ancient Greek and Japanese mythology are all motifs that are usually present in SMT and Persona games. This has led to a consistently murky tone throughout the series, in the undertones when not overtly. While the darkest game in the series is up for debate, theres no debating which is the brightest: Persona 4. Released just 2 years after the decidedly grim Persona 3, and on the same engine, P4 delivers an overall joyful and optimistic tone that helped it stand out not only from its predecessor, but from previous Persona and SMT games as well. This may seem counter-intuitive, as the focus of the story is on finding a murder suspect who kills 2 people within hours of the games beginning. Yet its the moment-to-moment dialogue, the soundtrack, even the color palette (the yellow theme provides an overall sunny disposition) that makes Persona 4 not only a joyful experience, but a joy to experience.',N'2024-01-10'),

The writing is really funny due to how hard it tries to be edgy, but you probably already knew that. This game is definitely worth watching the cutscenes for, or maybe even doing one of the routes in, but going for that final boss or if you are really a masochist going for 100% all route variation completion just aint worth it fam. damn.',N'2024-01-29'),

Thankfully, Lost Legacy compensates nicely with a shorter story, that doesnt ask too much of the player while still hitting all the correct beats. The gameplay improvements made in 4 make a triumphant return, though the climbing is still annoying. Each big set-piece is dynamic and exciting, the game never lingers too long or moves on too quickly. On the open-zone section in the beginning I have conflicted feelings. On one hand, the dialouge between Chloe and Nadine is charming and entertaining without feeling too artificial, and I enjoyed the scenery. However, this series has always been about maintaining momentum. I now have a newfound appreciation for the sublime pacing of the older games, after experiencing what it feels like to lose that forward-moving feeling. The game definietly picks up the tempo again afterwards, but I cant say the section left a good impression overall. The rest of the game is exactly as one would expect. The villain is nothing special, the platforming is cool and rhytmic, but not very complex, and there arent really any themes to delve into beyond the absolute minimum stuff.

Every action scene is copied from another Uncharted game and the structure add nothing to mechanics and functionality.

Sewers and Lab. I also didnt really like Carlos too much honestly and found him annoying, and I was also missing the city in chaos part.

Nemesis is cool though, I like the funny zombie guy. I wish he showed up more frequently and stalked you all throughout the map, but the times he does show up can be exciting, and the man runs at you like a football player which is awesome.

Regardless of your opinion of the state of the meta in this game or in the OCG, it is easily the most accessible way to experience the mechanics that have been added over the years. Easy to keep track of yours and your opponents graveyard and banished cards, easy to keep track of what the effects of yours and your opponents cards do, and basically not have to deal with any of the BS that would come with dueling with someone that is using an archetype that you havent played against before or not being up to date with the rules of the card game in real life. Its also the least expensive way to experience the game. As a programmer, I also very much appreciate what had to be taken to account how all these cards should interact with each other and always work how they are supposed to exactly like following the effect of the cards and rules if you were to duel in real life, all the while the game being smooth and not very resource hungry.

The concept is addicting but I believe the true reason why this game popped off hard was due to its character. No longer were you shooting aliens in a generic spaceship, you were a character with a name getting chased by other characters with names and even their own personalities. I dont know if this was the first game EVER to do such a thing (probably not), but it was the first to do it and really explode in popularity. The power dynamic flipping whenever you get a power pellet is also a pretty cartoony mechanic in its own right which makes the game just have this cartoonish charm.

Who knew a story about a pro sportsball player getting isekaied into some kinda death cult continent would be so solid?? I am not afraid to admit that I cried several times.

(611, 1,N'Marvel Snap was the biggest surprise of 2022. I have never been a fan of card game portions of games. Less than 5 hours of my life as Geralt was spent on Gwent, triple triad in FFXIV does nothing for me and I actively despised Joustus in king of cards. Im also not a big fan of mobile games as they are typically shallow affairs that never hold my attention. So for Marvel snap to be my most played game to release in 2022 and a near ever-present in my daily life, they must have got something right. The key to marvel snap is that its easy to pick up and hard to master. Each card is both a part of marvels illustrious history and a chess piece that can change the game if used correctly. A game of marvel snap lasts less than 5 minutes so its easy to justify trying different combination of cards as picking cards with poor synergy will not cost you much. The process of developing  wining decks is as satisfying as learning the ropes in any fighting game. The games various locations that impact each match only add to the complexity as you alter your strategy based on there affects as well as your opponents moves. The snap is a genius mechanic that forces you to either call there bluff or fold like its a high stake poker game.  The ability to upgrade your cards, so they are 3D holographic brings back childhood memories , alongside giving the game a engaging gameplay loop. Upgrading your cards, daily challenges and season challenges keep me coming back day after day.  Not being able to buy unique cards is one of the best decisions the devs ever made and allows me to come back day after day unlocking new cards, getting a holographic card collection my childhood self could only dream of and switching between strategies to keep the game fresh is a wining formula  where the marvel licence is only  the cherry on top of a delicious cake.',N'2024-08-22'),

(611, 7,N'I played this game every day between October 1 and February 7. The gameplay of Snap is excellent, and for a while the treadmill is really enticing—I earned new cards at a pace and in an order that successfully sparked some inspiration in the new combos I could try. When that happened, I could play dozens of games whittling the new deck and strategy down, until I got something new that did the same thing, and so on. As deck variety increases so does strategic complexity, and the game is excellent at getting you time and opportunity to explore its systems; theres not many explicit tutorials, but the card effects are simple and the at your decks grows feels so natural. It must be said the card game itself feels really well-designed and balanced, and for many characters right on theme. I had a great time for a long time.',N'2024-01-12'),

There are a ton of cutscenes and QTEs, and the gameplay itself is fun but nothing of real depth. Dont get me wrong, I didnt hate it and enjoyed the ride despite this essential being an interactive movie with some shmup or beat em sections. The shmup sections I actually found to be tedious and not really all that fun to play. The gameplay in these sections feel like they are too easy and youre just locking on until something blows up, with little player agency. It lacks weight until the end where the difficulty is cranked in these sections. As previously mentioned, the combat is serviceable but nothing to really write home about. I think more combos and variety wouldve put this another tier up. I think the game gets maybe a little too bonkers and self-indulgent at points with Asura and his rage, but it kind of adds to the insanity of the story.

(624, 6,N'Peace Walker is by all accounts a worthy canonical chapter in the saga, with its own dignity in terms of the themes covered and consideration for the in-depth development of the characters. On the gameplay experience aspects, it is also a pretty good transposition of the mechanics from previous games to a handheld console, especially considering the major limitations of the psp: clearly affected by this are mainly the ai of the enemies, the complexity of the environments and a certain overall fluidity of the experience, which can initially seem quite clunky. Good choices were therefore to model the gameplay in a relatively short mission structure, to increase action sequences over stealth phases and to be inspired by the type of games proposed by the highly successful titles on psp, such as Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. The result is a very fun game with various customization options and a very high level of replayability with an almost arcade-like flavor in improving your gaming execution, that may annoy those who rightly believe that such a title deserved more attention, but which in the end, considering the finished product, turns out to be decidedly remarkable.',N'2024-01-15'),

Players expecting a similar experience to previously mentioned games would be in for a big surprise, as this title lacked all the tropes you would expect in a typical RPG; no levels, no parties, no item shops, no grinding. Vagrant Story\s main appeal, at the time and currently, is its diversion from the norm of what RPGs were expected to be.

I’ve played most of the Tony Hawk games, never had problems with sfx before and since grinding is one of the main attractions, this is just sad. 2: Not enough special tricks to choose from especially grabs. 3: The licensed music is kinda bland overall. I wish they did the GTA approach, have different genre based radio stations, or just make it really interesting like JSRF, but we all know that’s not how this franchise rolls. Other than these main issues, the game is fantastic. I had a moment while playing Venice Beach, listening to a playlist I made and it was absolutely sublime. I can see myself getting addicted to the speed running mode, which is a bit scary but it’s so fun. Visually stunning, runs on my laptop smoothly. Nice custom skater options.

A shame, too, because this Deus Ex Universe initiative could\ve been some of the best shit in videogames if it weren\t for the Warner Bros. retardation that somehow found it\s way in Square Enix, trying to establish some sort of big franchise off the back of one successful game and a promising sequel you decide to not have enough faith in at the last minute, which only goes to ruin any prospects your franchise might have had in the first place. I hope that Eidos Montreal is now at least in a real position to make a real continuation of this game, because, though the social commentary isn\t the best, the aesthetics and the immersive-simmness of the Deus Ex reboot games cannot be left by the wayside.

This game uses levels but it doesn’t detract from the experience they’re well built and structured with shortcuts akin to Dark Souls 1. With it being a prequel of sorts to Nioh 1 it can be played in isolation and I honestly recommend it it’s much tougher than Nioh 1 but because of this it makes it easier to jump into a Nioh 1 playthrough since it’s the same game but with less mechanics overall such as burst counters and Yokai attacks.

The other gamemodes also give lonely fighters like myself much more to do than just playing arcade mode and getting clapped by dumb AI enemies over and over.

The actual story is not good, though. It starts off interesting, but has absolutely zero pay-off in any way, shape, or form.

And exploring the station was fun the first time, but after that you just kinda mindlessly run around it looking for new intel pick-ups after every level. It’s nothing special, but offers a nice repose from the combat. The combat is pretty simple, but effective. You have a sword, and some guns. I mostly played aggressively, not using guns for the most part. Just slashing around, and finding it very fun. Attacking, and parrying. This being a game made by former Ninja Gaiden devs, I’m sure there’s plenty of secret techniques that deepen the combat. But I’m a scrub, and don’t know anything about that. I did discover block canceling tho, and felt like a genius. The actual game is pretty hard. Those ninjas, man… A nice challenge is a good thing, but the checkpoint placement really grinded my gears.

(671, 6,N'I think the most interesting thing about Valkyrie Elysium is that it’s not a story about saving the world. It’s about what happens in that period where everything is ending already. Most of my time playing this game was spent in ruins, fighting the vengeful spirits that still roam the land alongside those spirits who chose to fight with me and listening to the voices that had long perished. And although Odin tells you from the beginning that your efforts are done so save it, actually walking through Valkyrie Elysiums world, the question haunted me: What is there left so save? This question is at the heart of the game. Spoilers follow The Valkyrie, a hollow shell at the beginning, distanced from the world she wants to save, becomes more and more involved over the course of the story – through the help of the spirits that chose to stay with her. And in the end, the player must choose what to do with that involvement. The different endings all give a different answer to the questions “What is there left to save? What is there left to fight for?”. The so-called “true ending” has a somewhat cynical answer to this: That the gods who were responsible for the worlds’ demise will not see the next one. Another ending plainly states: heterosexual love. In every ending the world we walked through in the game ends. The agency of the player is to decide what happens next.',N'2024-08-07'),

(674, 5,N'Since I just played the first one too most of my opinions are basically comparisons, but I do think both games are very good with different highs and lows between the two. This one has an actual story this time, unlike the last one which was a collection of somewhat thrown together get to and beat the guy levels threaded together loosely (especially in the DS version). This time there\s a thread that runs from the start to the end and is helped by the new-to-the-series voiced characters and script which thankfully doesn\t quite fall into the overly quirky style that later games would become defined by. The levels, while occasionally a little too long, are still very engaging though i\m not sure which games levels really kept my attention better. Despite being DC Super Heroes it\s still hugely Batman skewed, you\d have to wait for another sequel to really reach into more DC character territory, but this one had a nice roster of fun characters. I didn\t have much interest in 100%ing this time round but i\ve definitely come close before from what I remember, just that it takes a while and i\m not sure I want to play the same levels twice in a row immediately.

The music as well needs to be mentioned, as it is amazing and fits every levels unique artstyle perfectly. It is a bit on the shorter side but Id rather have a game that leaves me wanting more rather than thinking it was too much. I think my biggest complaint is that it is a little too easy. I dont normally play platformers and I found it not that challenging, where I usually messed up jumps because of timing rather than precision and movement. I dont mind games being easy, but I think I wouldve liked a little more challenge, especially with the enemies. Theyre all quite simple and are more objects rather than creatures you counter despite their cute designs.

(688, 9,N'Decent game. Great pixel art, decent OST, and the gameplay bangs to an extent. I think that if there were more in game incentives to make the player try new moves and experiment with different combos it would enhance the whole experience tenfold, since earlygame unlocking new moves was exciting with trying to lab out cool combos, but by lategame I was mostly just spamming the one combo I know that worked to defeat most encounters, which gets kinda boring. Theres a dab move though, so this game is turbo based on that basis alone. The writing and the voice acting delivery of said writing was kinda cringe to me personally but idk other people might like it. I do think it is a mild bit bizarre for the game to not have any japanese voices when the game is a spinoff of a predominantly japanese exclusive game series, but eh it probably wasnt really in the budget, plus who tf is making new kunio kun games in the year of our lord 2019 anyways. all in all, a decent beat em up but mans still likes castle crashers and streets of rage 4 more than this',N'2025-09-26'),

(689, 0,N'Hm. This game is certainly something, alright. I guess Ill preface this by saying that if you have never played a sonic game before, this will definitely be the easiest way to go to enjoy those games. To a casual fan, this is a great way to enjoy the classic sonic series. However, as a more serious sonic fan, this compilation is so, so,\n                     \n                      SO\n                     \n                     agonizingly close to being a definitive experience for all these classic titles, but falls just barely short of actually taking those titles from their fan-developed counterparts. A compilation that is somehow less than the sum of its parts is a very strange thing indeed. You get the Taxman remastered ports of sonic 1, 2, and CD here with the drop dash included, plus a brand new port of sonic 3 & knuckles also with drop dash support and in widescreen for the first time. The games all play perfectly fine but theres just a bunch of tiny little annoyances that add up over time, such as tails AI not really working all that right and you constantly hear him jumping and smashing into things offscreen which can be annoying, theres some occasional bugs and whatnot, and they absolutely BUTCHERED the audio in sonic 3, using lower-quality audio recordings of the game audio plus worse re-recordings of replacement tunes for the licensed tracks. By all accounts and purposes especially considering how much I love sonic, I should have absolutely loved this compilation, but instead I just found myself kinda eh on it.',N'2025-03-28'),
(689, 1,N'Its legit the best way to play the classic Sonic Games as of today. The basic improvements like resolution are there, the mission mode is super fun and the new cutscenes are fantastic!

(691, 4,N'Didnt like it as much as the first game, but pikmin always goes hard. While it adds a whole lot of new bells and whistles to the pikmin experience with the new pikmin types and sprays n whatnot, while also adding a whole lot of quality of life such as removing the time limit, it kinda falls flat for me personally because of the new shift into dungeon crawling that the game goes into. Pikmin 1 had a bunch of wide maps to explore, find where everything is, and then formulate an attack plan on how to get it all as efficiently as possible. With the dungeon system of this game, levels feel more like hubs to enter dungeons, where there you solve various linear puzzles and combat challenges. The vibes are different. I feel like while this game has a lot more content and mechanics than Pikmin 1, the first game was overall more focused on what it wanted to be.',N'2024-11-13'),

The movie references also fall flat if you have little to no experience or exposure to the movies they are referencing, and since im more of a gamer man than a movie buff, those references mostly flew over my head. I havent seen the matrix, saving private ryan, or alien so the entire levels based on those movies are kinda lost on me. If you have a general taste for movies and like rare platformers and raunchy humor, I dont think you could do any wrong with this game, but if you are an uncultured swine (me) you might be scatching your head wondering why this game was super hyped up.
